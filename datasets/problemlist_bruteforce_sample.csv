4, A, A. Watermelon, One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home dying of thirst and decided to divide the berry however they faced a hard problem.Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible that's why you should help them and find out if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure each of them should get a part of positive weight.,The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 ≤ w ≤ 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.,Print YES if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.
231, A, A. Team, One day three best friends Petya Vasya and Tonya decided to form a team and take part in programming contests. Participants are usually offered several problems during programming contests. Long before the start the friends decided that they will implement a problem if at least two of them are sure about the solution. Otherwise the friends won't write the problem's solution.This contest offers n problems to the participants. For each problem we know which friend is sure about the solution. Help the friends find the number of problems for which they will write a solution., The first input line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of problems in the contest. Then n lines contain three integers each each integer is either 0 or 1. If the first number in the line equals 1 then Petya is sure about the problem's solution otherwise he isn't sure. The second number shows Vasya's view on the solution the third number shows Tonya's view. The numbers on the lines are separated by spaces., Print a single integer — the number of problems the friends will implement on the contest
236, A, A. Boy or Girl, Those days many boys use beautiful girls' photos as avatars in forums. So it is pretty hard to tell the gender of a user at the first glance. Last year our hero went to a forum and had a nice chat with a beauty (he thought so). After that they talked very often and eventually they became a couple in the network.But yesterday he came to see "her" in the real world and found out "she" is actually a very strong man! Our hero is very sad and he is too tired to love again now. So he came up with a way to recognize users' genders by their user names.This is his method: if the number of distinct characters in one's user name is odd then he is a male otherwise she is a female. You are given the string that denotes the user name please help our hero to determine the gender of this user by his method., The first line contains a non-empty string that contains only lowercase English letters — the user name. This string contains at most 100 letters., If it is a female by our hero's method print "CHAT WITH HER!" (without the quotes) otherwise print "IGNORE HIM!" (without the quotes).
122, A, A. Lucky Division, Petya loves lucky numbers. Everybody knows that lucky numbers are positive integers whose decimal representation contains only the lucky digits 4 and 7. For example numbers 47 744 4 are lucky and 5 17 467 are not.Petya calls a number almost lucky if it could be evenly divided by some lucky number. Help him find out if the given number n is almost lucky., The single line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number that needs to be checked., In the only line print "YES" (without the quotes) if number n is almost lucky. Otherwise print "NO" (without the quotes).
546, A, A. Soldier and Bananas, A soldier wants to buy w bananas in the shop. He has to pay k dollars for the first banana 2k dollars for the second one and so on (in other words he has to pay i·k dollars for the i-th banana).He has n dollars. How many dollars does he have to borrow from his friend soldier to buy w bananas? , The first line contains three positive integers k n w (1  ≤  k w  ≤  1000 0 ≤ n ≤ 109) the cost of the first banana initial number of dollars the soldier has and number of bananas he wants., Output one integer — the amount of dollars that the soldier must borrow from his friend. If he doesn't have to borrow money output 0.
580, A, A. Kefa and First Steps, Kefa decided to make some money doing business on the Internet for exactly n days. He knows that on the i-th day (1 ≤ i ≤ n) he makes a i money. Kefa loves progress that's why he wants to know the length of the maximum non-decreasing subsegment in sequence a i. Let us remind you that the subsegment of the sequence is its continuous fragment. A subsegment of numbers is called non-decreasing if all numbers in it follow in the non-decreasing order.Help Kefa cope with this task!, The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105).The second line contains n integers a 1  a 2  ...  a n (1 ≤ a i ≤ 109)., Print a single integer — the length of the maximum non-decreasing subsegment of sequence a.
271, A, A. Beautiful Year, It seems like the year of 2013 came only yesterday. Do you know a curious fact? The year of 2013 is the first year after the old 1987 with only distinct digits.Now you are suggested to solve the following problem: given a year number find the minimum year number which is strictly larger than the given one and has only distinct digits., The single line contains integer y (1000 ≤ y ≤ 9000) — the year number., Print a single integer — the minimum year number that is strictly larger than y and all it's digits are distinct. It is guaranteed that the answer exists.
479, A, A. Expression, Petya studies in a school and he adores Maths. His class has been studying arithmetic expressions. On the last class the teacher wrote three positive integers a b c on the blackboard. The task was to insert signs of operations '+' and '*' and probably brackets between the numbers so that the value of the resulting expression is as large as possible. Let's consider an example: assume that the teacher wrote numbers 1 2 and 3 on the blackboard. Here are some ways of placing signs and brackets: 1+2*3=7 1*(2+3)=5 1*2*3=6 (1+2)*3=9 Note that you can insert operation signs only between a and b and between b and c that is you cannot swap integers. For instance in the given sample you cannot get expression (1+3)*2.It's easy to see that the maximum value that you can obtain is 9.Your task is: given a b and c print the maximum value that you can get., The input contains three integers a b and c each on a single line (1 ≤ a b c ≤ 10)., Print the maximum value of the expression that you can obtain.
25, A , A. IQ test, Bob is preparing to pass IQ test. The most frequent task in this test is to find out which one of the given n numbers differs from the others.

The second line contains n space-separated natural numbers not exceeding 100. It is guaranteed that exactly one of these numbers differs from the others in evenness., Output index of number that differs from the others in evenness. Numbers are numbered from 1 in the input order.
268, A, A. Games, Manao works on a sports TV. He's spent much time watching the football games of some country. After a while he began to notice different patterns. For example each team has two sets of uniforms: home uniform and guest uniform. When a team plays a game at home the players put on the home uniform. When a team plays as a guest on somebody else's stadium the players put on the guest uniform. The only exception to that rule is: when the home uniform color of the host team matches the guests' uniform the host team puts on its guest uniform as well. For each team the color of the home and guest uniform is different.There are n teams taking part in the national championship. The championship consists of n·(n - 1) games: each team invites each other team to its stadium. At this point Manao wondered: how many times during the championship is a host team going to put on the guest uniform? Note that the order of the games does not affect this number.You know the colors of the home and guest uniform for each team. For simplicity the colors are numbered by integers in such a way that no two distinct colors have the same number. Help Manao find the answer to his question., The first line contains an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 30). Each of the following n lines contains a pair of distinct space-separated integers h i a i (1 ≤ h i a i ≤ 100) — the colors of the i-th team's home and guest uniforms respectively. In a single line print the number of games where the host team is going to play in the guest uniform.

460, A, A. Vasya and Socks, Vasya has n pairs of socks. In the morning of each day Vasya has to put on a pair of socks before he goes to school. When he comes home in the evening Vasya takes off the used socks and throws them away. Every m-th day (at days with numbers m 2m 3m ...) mom buys a pair of socks to Vasya. She does it late in the evening so that Vasya cannot put on a new pair of socks before the next day. How many consecutive days pass until Vasya runs out of socks?, The single line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 100; 2 ≤ m ≤ 100) separated by a space., Print a single integer — the answer to the problem.
155, A, A. I_love_%username%, Vasya adores sport programming. He can't write programs but he loves to watch the contests' progress. Vasya even has a favorite coder and Vasya pays special attention to him. One day Vasya decided to collect the results of all contests where his favorite coder participated and track the progress of his coolness. For each contest where this coder participated he wrote out a single non-negative number — the number of points his favorite coder earned in the contest. Vasya wrote out the points for the contest in the order in which the contests run (naturally no two contests ran simultaneously).Vasya considers a coder's performance in a contest amazing in two situations: he can break either his best or his worst performance record. First it is amazing if during the contest the coder earns strictly more points that he earned on each past contest. Second it is amazing if during the contest the coder earns strictly less points that he earned on each past contest. A coder's first contest isn't considered amazing. Now he wants to count the number of amazing performances the coder had throughout his whole history of participating in contests. But the list of earned points turned out long and Vasya can't code... That's why he asks you to help him., The first line contains the single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of contests where the coder participated.The next line contains n space-separated non-negative integer numbers — they are the points which the coder has earned. The points are given in the chronological order. All points do not exceed 10000., Print the single number — the number of amazing performances the coder has had during his whole history of participating in the contests.

732, A, A. Buy a Shovel, Polycarp urgently needs a shovel! He comes to the shop and chooses an appropriate one. The shovel that Policarp chooses is sold for k burles. Assume that there is an unlimited number of such shovels in the shop. In his pocket Polycarp has an unlimited number of "10-burle coins" and exactly one coin of r burles (1 ≤ r ≤ 9). What is the minimum number of shovels Polycarp has to buy so that he can pay for the purchase without any change? It is obvious that he can pay for 10 shovels without any change (by paying the requied amount of 10-burle coins and not using the coin of r burles). But perhaps he can buy fewer shovels and pay without any change. Note that Polycarp should buy at least one shovel., The single line of input contains two integers k and r (1 ≤ k ≤ 1000 1 ≤ r ≤ 9) — the price of one shovel and the denomination of the coin in Polycarp's pocket that is different from "10-burle coins". Remember that he has an unlimited number of coins in the denomination of 10 that is Polycarp has enough money to buy any number of shovels., Print the required minimum number of shovels Polycarp has to buy so that he can pay for them without any change.

935, A, A. Fafa and his Company, Fafa owns a company that works on huge projects. There are n employees in Fafa's company. Whenever the company has a new project to start working on Fafa has to divide the tasks of this project among all the employees. Fafa finds doing this every time is very tiring for him. So he decided to choose the best l employees in his company as team leaders. Whenever there is a new project Fafa will divide the tasks among only the team leaders and each team leader will be responsible of some positive number of employees to give them the tasks. To make this process fair for the team leaders each one of them should be responsible for the same number of employees. Moreover every employee who is not a team leader has to be under the responsibility of exactly one team leader and no team leader is responsible for another team leader. Given the number of employees n find in how many ways Fafa could choose the number of team leaders l in such a way that it is possible to divide employees between them evenly., The input consists of a single line containing a positive integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of employees in Fafa's company, Print a single integer representing the answer to the problem.
