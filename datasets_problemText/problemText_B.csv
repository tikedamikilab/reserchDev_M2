The first column has       number A, the second — number B, etc. till column 26 that is       marked by Z. Then there are two-letter numbers: column 27 has       number AA, 28 — AB, column 52 is marked by AZ. After ZZ there       follow three-letter numbers, etc. The rows are marked by integer numbers starting with 1. The cell       name is the concatenation of the column and the row numbers. For       example, BC23 is the name for the cell that is in column 55, row       23.  Sometimes another numeration system is used: RXCY, where X and Y       are integer numbers, showing the column and the row numbers       respectfully. For instance, R23C55 is the cell from the previous example. Your task is to write a program that reads the given sequence of       cell coordinates and produce each item written according to the       rules of another numeration system.","The first line of the input contains integer number  n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105), the number of coordinates in       the test.

7,"There is little time left before the release of the first       national operating system BerlOS. Some of its components are not       finished yet — the memory manager is among them. According to the       developers' plan, in the first release the memory manager will be       very simple and rectilinear. It will support three operations:  The memory model in this case is very simple. It is a sequence of          m bytes, numbered for convenience from the first       to the  m-th. The first operation alloc       n takes as the only parameter the size of the memory block       that is to be allocated. While processing this operation, a free       block of  n successive bytes is being allocated in the       memory. If the amount of such blocks is more than one, the block       closest to the beginning of the memory (i.e. to the first byte) is       prefered. All these bytes are marked as not free, and the memory       manager returns a 32-bit integer numerical token that is the       identifier of this block. If it is impossible to allocate a free       block of this size, the function returns NULL. The second operation erase       x takes as its parameter the identifier of some block. This       operation frees the system memory, marking the bytes of this block       as free for further use. In the case when this identifier does not       point to the previously allocated block, which has not been erased       yet, the function returns ILLEGAL_ERASE_ARGUMENT. The last operation defragment does not have any       arguments and simply brings the occupied memory sections closer to       the beginning of the memory without changing their respective order. In the current implementation you are to use successive integers,       starting with 1, as identifiers. Each successful alloc operation procession should       return following number. Unsuccessful alloc operations do not affect numeration. You are to write the implementation of the memory manager. You       should output the returned value for each alloc command. You should also       output ILLEGAL_ERASE_ARGUMENT for all       the failed erase commands.","The first line of the input data contains two positive integers          t and  m (1 ≤ t ≤ 100;1 ≤ m ≤ 100),       where  t — the amount of operations given to the memory       manager for processing, and  m — the available memory size in bytes. Then there       follow  t lines where the operations themselves are given.       The first operation is alloc       n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), where          n is an integer. The second one is erase x, where  x is an arbitrary 32-bit integer numerical token.       The third operation is defragment. ","Output the sequence of lines. Each line should contain either the       result of alloc operation       procession , or ILLEGAL_ERASE_ARGUMENT as a       result of failed erase       operation procession. Output lines should go in the same order in       which the operations are processed.

8,"The whole world got obsessed with robots,and to keep pace with       the progress, great Berland's programmer Draude decided to build       his own robot. He was working hard at the robot. He taught it to       walk the shortest path from one point to another, to record all       its movements, but like in many Draude's programs, there was a bug       — the robot didn't always walk the shortest path. Fortunately, the       robot recorded its own movements correctly. Now Draude wants to       find out when his robot functions wrong. Heh, if Draude only       remembered the map of the field, where he tested the robot, he       would easily say if the robot walked in the right direction or       not. But the field map was lost never to be found, that's why he       asks you to find out if there exist at least one map, where the       path recorded by the robot is the shortest. The map is an infinite checkered field, where each square is       either empty, or contains an obstruction. It is also known that       the robot never tries to run into the obstruction. By the recorded       robot's movements find out if there exist at least one such map,       that it is possible to choose for the robot a starting square (the       starting square should be empty) such that when the robot moves       from this square its movements coincide with the recorded ones       (the robot doesn't run into anything, moving along empty squares       only), and the path from the starting square to the end one is the shortest.

10,"All cinema halls in Berland are rectangles with  K rows of  K seats each, and  K is an odd number. Rows and seats are numbered       from 1 to  K. For safety reasons people, who come to the box       office to buy tickets, are not allowed to choose seats themselves.       Formerly the choice was made by a cashier, but now this is the       responsibility of a special seating program. It was found out that       the large majority of Berland's inhabitants go to the cinema in       order to watch a movie, that's why they want to sit as close to       the hall center as possible. Moreover, a company of  M people, who come to watch a movie, want       necessarily to occupy  M successive seats in one row. Let's formulate the       algorithm, according to which the program chooses seats and sells       tickets.

And its capital was       the place where our hero DravDe worked. He couldn’t program or       make up problems (in fact, few people saw a computer those days)       but he was nevertheless happy. He worked in a warehouse where a       magical but non-alcoholic drink Ogudar-Olok was kept. We won’t       describe his work in detail and take a better look at a simplified       version of the warehouse. The warehouse has one set of shelving.

The shelves are numbered from top to       bottom starting from 1 and the       sections of each shelf are numbered from left to right also       starting from 1. Each section can       contain exactly one box of the drink, and try as he might, DravDe       can never put a box in a section that already has one. In the       course of his work DravDe frequently notices that he has to put a       box in a filled section. In that case his solution is simple.       DravDe ignores that section and looks at the next one to the       right. If it is empty, he puts the box there. Otherwise he keeps       looking for the first empty section to the right. If no empty       section is found by the end of the shelf, he looks at the shelf       which is under it, then the next one, etc. Also each time he looks       at a new shelf he starts from the shelf’s beginning. If DravDe       still can’t find an empty section for the box, he immediately       drinks it all up and throws the empty bottles away not to be caught. After one great party with a lot of Ogudar-Olok drunk DravDe       asked you to help him.

Let us       denote the friend of the person number  i by  g(i). Note that the friendships are not       mutual, i.e.  g(g(i)) is not necessarily equal to          i. On day  i the person numbered as  a  i learns the news with the rating of  b  i ( b  i ≥ 1). He phones the friend immediately       and tells it. While he is doing it, the news becomes old and its       rating falls a little and becomes equal to  b  i - 1. The friend does the same thing — he       also calls his friend and also tells the news. The friend of the       friend gets the news already rated as  b  i - 2. It all continues until the rating       of the news reaches zero as nobody wants to tell the news with       zero rating.

After considerable       brain racking and some pre-estimating, the sponsor representatives       ordered a certain number of T-shirts of sizes S, M, L, XL and XXL.       The T-shirts turned out to bring good luck, that's why on the       contest day there built up a line of  K participants willing to get one. Every       contestant is characterized by his/her desired T-shirt size (so it       happens that for all the participants it is also one of the sizes       S, M, L, XL and XXL).

The rest       is simple: he should choose in which part of the garden to build       the house. In the evening he sat at his table and drew the       garden’s plan. On the plan the garden is represented as a       rectangular checkered field  n × m in size divided into squares whose       side length is 1. In some squares Vasya marked the trees growing       there (one shouldn’t plant the trees too close to each other       that’s why one square contains no more than one tree). Vasya wants       to find a rectangular land lot  a × b squares in size to build a house on,       at that the land lot border should go along the lines of the grid       that separates the squares. All the trees that grow on the       building lot will have to be chopped off.

Now Vasya has to       choose a base  p and regard the expression as written in the base          p positional notation. Vasya understood that he       can get different results with different bases, and some bases are       even invalid. For example, expression 78 + 87 in the base 16 positional notation       is equal to  FF 16, in the base 15       positional notation it is equal to 11015, in the base 10 one — to 16510,       in the base 9 one — to 1769, and in the base 8 or       lesser-based positional notations the expression is invalid as all       the numbers should be strictly less than the positional notation       base.

The resulting task is even more       challenging than the classic puzzle: now all the fragments have       the same rectangular shape, and one can assemble the puzzle only       relying on the picture drawn on the pieces.

For example, if          n = 8, then initially Vasya's coins were kept in       the order 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8.       If Vasya's younger brother chose the segment [2, 6], then after the reversal the coin       order will change to 1 6 5 4 3 2 7       8. Vasya suspects that someone else could have spoilt the       permutation after his brother. Help him to find that out. Check if       the given permutation can be obtained from the permutation 1 2 ...  n using exactly one segment reversal. If       it is possible, find the segment itself.","The first line contains an integer  n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) which is the number       of coins in Vasya's collection.

57,"Chris the Rabbit found the traces of an ancient Martian       civilization. The brave astronomer managed to see through a small       telescope an architecture masterpiece — ""A Road to the       Sun"". The building stands on cubical stones of the same size.       The foundation divides the entire ""road"" into cells,       into which the cubical stones are fit tightly. Thus, to any cell       of the foundation a coordinate can be assigned. To become the       leader of the tribe, a Martian should build a Road to the Sun,       that is to build from those cubical stones on a given foundation a       stairway. The stairway should be described by the number of stones       in the initial coordinate and the coordinates of the stairway's       beginning and end. Each following cell in the coordinate's       increasing order should contain one cubical stone more than the       previous one. At that if the cell has already got stones, they do       not count in this building process, the stairways were simply       built on them. In other words, let us assume that a stairway is       built with the initial coordinate of  l, the final coordinate of  r and the number of stones in the initial       coordinate  x. That means that  x stones will be       added in the cell  l,  x + 1 stones will be added in the cell  l + 1, ...,  x + r - l stones will be added in       the cell  r. Chris managed to find an ancient manuscript, containing the       descriptions of all the stairways. Now he wants to compare the       data to be sure that he has really found ""A Road to the       Sun"". For that he chose some road cells and counted the total       number of cubical stones that has been accumulated throughout the       Martian history and then asked you to count using the manuscript       to what the sum should ideally total.","The first line contains three space-separated integers:  n, m, k (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 105, 1 ≤ k ≤ min(n, 100))       which is the number of cells, the number of ""Roads to the       Sun"" and the number of cells in the query correspondingly.

Some days before the contest, the teacher took a very       simple-looking exam and all his  n students took part in the exam. The teacher gave       them 3 strings and asked them to         concatenate them.       Concatenating strings means to put them in some arbitrary order       one after the other. For example from concatenating Alireza and Amir we can get to AlirezaAmir or AmirAlireza depending on the       order of concatenation. Unfortunately enough, the teacher forgot to ask students to       concatenate their strings in a pre-defined order so each student       did it the way he/she liked.

He rather       likes to finish up with it as soon as possible and take his time       to solve 3-SAT in polynomial time. Moreover, the teacher has given       some advice that Shapur has to follow.

63,"In a strategic computer game ""Settlers II"" one has to       build defense structures to expand and protect the territory.       Let's take one of these buildings. At the moment the defense       structure accommodates exactly  n soldiers. Within this task we can assume that       the number of soldiers in the defense structure won't either       increase or decrease. Every soldier has a rank — some natural number from 1 to  k. 1 stands for a       private and  k stands for a general. The higher the rank of the       soldier is, the better he fights. Therefore, the player profits       from having the soldiers of the highest possible rank. To increase the ranks of soldiers they need to train. But the       soldiers won't train for free, and each training session requires       one golden coin. On each training session all the  n soldiers are present. At the end of each training session the soldiers' ranks increase       as follows. First all the soldiers are divided into groups with       the same rank, so that the least possible number of groups is       formed. Then, within each of the groups where the soldiers below       the rank  k are present, exactly one soldier increases his       rank by one. You know the ranks of all  n soldiers at the moment.

The garden is very       unusual as each of the square sections possesses its own fixed       height and due to the newest irrigation system we can create       artificial rain above each section.

71,"A progress bar is an element of graphical interface that displays       the progress of a process for this very moment before it is       completed. Let's take a look at the following form of such a bar. A bar is represented as  n squares, located in line. To add clarity, let's       number them with positive integers from 1 to  n from the left to the right. Each square has       saturation ( a  i for the  i-th square), which is measured by an integer from         0 to  k. When the bar for some  i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) is displayed,       squares 1, 2, ... , i - 1 has       the saturation  k, squares  i + 1, i + 2, ... , n has the       saturation 0, and the saturation of       the square  i can have any value from 0 to  k. So some first squares of the progress bar always have the       saturation  k. Some last squares always have the saturation         0. And there is no more than one       square that has the saturation different from 0 and  k. The degree of the process's completion is measured in percents.       Let the process be  t% completed.

74,"A stowaway and a controller play the following game.  The train is represented by  n wagons which are numbered with positive integers       from 1 to  n from the head to the tail. The stowaway and the       controller are initially in some two different wagons. Every       minute the train can be in one of two conditions — moving or idle.       Every minute the players move. The controller's move is as follows. The controller has the       movement direction — to the train's head or to its tail. During a       move the controller moves to the neighbouring wagon       correspondingly to its movement direction. If at the end of his       move the controller enters the 1-st       or the  n-th wagon, that he changes the direction of his       movement into the other one. In other words, the controller       cyclically goes from the train's head to its tail and back again       during all the time of a game, shifting during each move by one       wagon. Note, that the controller always have exactly one possible move. The stowaway's move depends from the state of the train. If the       train is moving, then the stowaway can shift to one of       neighbouring wagons or he can stay where he is without moving. If       the train is at a station and is idle, then the stowaway leaves       the train (i.e. he is now not present in any train wagon) and       then, if it is not the terminal train station, he enters the train       again into any of  n wagons (not necessarily into the one he's just       left and not necessarily into the neighbouring one). If the train       is idle for several minutes then each such minute the stowaway       leaves the train and enters it back. Let's determine the order of the players' moves. If at the given       minute the train is moving, then first the stowaway moves and then       the controller does. If at this minute the train is idle, then       first the stowaway leaves the train, then the controller moves and       then the stowaway enters the train. If at some point in time the stowaway and the controller happen       to be in one wagon, then the controller wins: he makes the       stowaway pay fine. If after a while the stowaway reaches the       terminal train station, then the stowaway wins: he simply leaves       the station during his move and never returns there again. At any moment of time the players know each other's positions.       The players play in the optimal way. Specifically, if the       controller wins, then the stowaway plays so as to lose as late as       possible. As all the possible moves for the controller are       determined uniquely, then he is considered to play optimally       always. Determine the winner.","The first line contains three integers  n,  m and  k.

85,"In an embassy of a well-known kingdom an electronic queue is       organised. Every person who comes to the embassy, needs to make       the following three actions: show the ID, pay money to the cashier       and be fingerprinted. Besides, the         actions should be performed in the given order. For each action several separate windows are singled out:  k 1 separate windows for the       first action (the first type windows),  k 2 windows for the second       one (the second type windows), and  k 3 for the third one (the       third type windows). The service time for one person in any of the       first type window equals to  t 1. Similarly, it takes          t 2 time to serve a person       in any of the second type windows. And it takes  t 3 to serve one person in       any of the third type windows. Thus, the service time depends only       on the window type and is independent from the person who is       applying for visa. At some moment  n people come to the embassy, the  i-th person comes at the moment of time  c  i. The person is registered under some       number. After that he sits in the hall and waits for his number to       be shown on a special board. Besides the person's number the board       shows the number of the window where one should go and the person       goes there immediately. Let's consider that the time needed to       approach the window is negligible. The table can show information       for no more than one person at a time. The electronic queue works       so as to immediately start working with the person who has       approached the window, as there are no other people in front of       the window. The Client Service Quality inspectors noticed that several people       spend too much time in the embassy (this is particularly tiresome       as the embassy has no mobile phone reception and 3G). It was       decided to organise the system so that the largest time a person       spends in the embassy were minimum. Help the inspectors organise       the queue. Consider that all actions except for being served in at       the window, happen instantly.","The first line contains three space-separated integers  k 1,  k 2,  k 3 (1 ≤ k  i ≤ 109),       they are the number of windows of the first, second and third type correspondingly. The second line contains three space-separated integers  t 1,  t 2,  t 3 (1 ≤ t  i ≤ 105),       they are the periods of time needed to serve one person in the       window of the first, second and third type correspondingly.  The third line contains an integer  n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105), it is the number of people. The fourth line contains  n space-separated integers  c  i (1 ≤ c  i ≤ 109) in       the non-decreasing order;  c  i is the time when the person number  i comes to the embassy.","Print the single number, the maximum time a person will spend in       the embassy if the queue is organized optimally. Please, do not use the %lld specificator to read or       write 64-bit integers in C++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams (also you may use       the %I64d specificator).","In the first test 5 people come simultaneously at the moment of       time equal to 1. There is one window of every type, it takes 1       unit of time to be served at each window. That's why the maximal       time a person spends in the embassy is the time needed to be       served at the windows (3 units of time) plus the time the last       person who comes to the first window waits (4 units of time).  Windows in the second test work like this: The first window of the first type: [1, 6) — the first person, [6, 11) — third person, [11, 16) — fifth person The second window of the first type: [2, 7) — the second person,  [7, 12) — the fourth person The only second type window: [6, 7)       — first, [7, 8) — second, [11, 12) — third, [12, 13) — fourth, [16, 17) — fifth The only third type window: [7, 8)       — first, [8, 9) — second, [12, 13) — third, [13, 14) — fourth, [17, 18) — fifth We can see that it takes most time to serve the fifth person."
86,"Physicist Woll likes to play one relaxing game in between his       search of the theory of everything. Game interface consists of a rectangular  n × m playing field and a dashboard.       Initially some cells of the playing field are filled while others       are empty. Dashboard contains images of all various connected (we       mean connectivity by side) figures of 2, 3, 4 and 5 cells, with       all their rotations and reflections. Player can copy any figure       from the dashboard and place it anywhere at the still empty cells       of the playing field. Of course any figure can be used as many       times as needed. Woll's aim is to fill the whole field in such a way that there       are no empty cells left, and also... just have some fun. Every initially empty cell should be filled with exactly one cell       of some figure. Every figure should be entirely inside the board. In the picture black cells stand for initially filled cells of       the field, and one-colour regions represent the figures.","First line contains integers  n and  m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 1000) — the       height and the width of the field correspondingly. Next  n lines contain  m symbols each.

Otherwise output any filling       of the field by the figures in the following format: each figure       should be represented by some digit and figures that touch each       other by side should be represented by distinct digits. Every       initially filled cell should be represented by ""#"".","In the third sample, there is no way to fill a cell with no empty neighbours. In the forth sample, Woll does not have to fill anything, so we       should output the field from the input."
87,"Programmer Vasya is studying a new programming language &K*.       The &K* language resembles the languages of the C family in       its syntax. However, it is more powerful, which is why the rules       of the actual C-like languages are unapplicable to it. To fully       understand the statement, please read the language's description       below carefully and follow it and not the similar rules in real       programming languages. There is a very powerful system of pointers on &K* — you can       add an asterisk to the right of the existing type  X — that will result in new type  X * . That is called pointer-definition operation.       Also, there is the operation that does the opposite — to any type       of  X, which is a pointer, you can add an ampersand —       that will result in a type &X, to which refers  X. That is called a dereference operation. The &K* language has only two basic data types — void and errtype. Also, the language has       operators typedef and typeof. An attempt of dereferencing of the void type will lead to an error:       to a special data type errtype. For errtype the following equation       holds true: errtype*  =  &errtype  =  errtype. An attempt to use       the data type that hasn't been defined before that will also lead       to the errtype. Using typedef, we can       define one type several times. Of all the definitions only the       last one is valid. However, all the types that have been defined       earlier using this type do not change. Let us also note that the dereference operation has the lower       priority that the pointer operation, in other words &T *  is always equal to  T. Note, that the operators are executed consecutively one by one.       If we have two operators ""typedef &void a"" and         ""typedef a* b"",       then at first a becomes         errtype, and after that         b becomes errtype* = errtype, but not &void* = void (see sample 2). Vasya does not yet fully understand this powerful technology,       that's why he asked you to help him. Write a program that analyzes       these operators. ","The first line contains an integer  n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of       operators. Then follow  n lines with operators. Each operator is of one of       two types: either ""typedef            A  B"", or ""typeof  A"". In the first case the  B type differs from void and errtype types, and besides,       doesn't have any asterisks and ampersands. All the data type names are non-empty lines of no more than 20       lowercase Latin letters. The number of asterisks and ampersands       separately in one type in any operator does not exceed 10, however       if we bring some types to void with several asterisks,       their number may exceed 10.",For every typeof operator       print on the single line the answer to that operator — the type       that the given operator returned.,"Let's look at the second sample. After the first two queries typedef the b type is equivalent to void*, and с — to void**. The next query typedef       redefines b — it is now       equal to &b = &void* =       void. At that, the с       type doesn't change. After that the с type is       defined as &&b* =         &&void* = &void = errtype. It doesn't       influence the b type,       that's why the next typedef       defines c as &void* = void. Then the b type is again       redefined as &void =       errtype.  Please note that the c       type in the next query is defined exactly as errtype******* = errtype, and       not &void******* =       void******. The same happens in the last typedef."
88,"Vasya learns to type. He has an unusual keyboard at his disposal:       it is rectangular and it has  n rows of keys containing  m keys in each row. Besides, the keys are of two       types. Some of the keys have lowercase Latin letters on them and       some of the keys work like the ""Shift"" key on standard       keyboards, that is, they make lowercase letters uppercase. Vasya can press one or two keys with one hand. However, he can       only press two keys if the Euclidean distance between the centers       of the keys does not exceed  x. The keys are considered as squares with a side       equal to 1. There are no empty spaces between neighbouring keys. Vasya is a very lazy boy, that's why he tries to type with one       hand as he eats chips with his other one. However, it is possible       that some symbol can't be typed with one hand only, because the       distance between it and the closest ""Shift"" key is       strictly larger than  x. In this case he will have to use his other       hand. Having typed the symbol, Vasya returns other hand back to       the chips. You are given Vasya's keyboard and the text. Count the minimum       number of times Vasya will have to use the other hand.","The first line contains three integers  n,  m,  x (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 30, 1 ≤ x ≤ 50). Next  n lines contain descriptions of all the keyboard       keys. Each line contains the descriptions of exactly  m keys, without spaces. The letter keys are marked       with the corresponding lowercase letters. The ""Shift""       keys are marked with the ""S"" symbol.  Then follow the length of the text  q (1 ≤ q ≤ 5·105). The last line contains the       text  T, which consists of  q symbols, which are uppercase and lowercase Latin letters.","If Vasya can type the text, then print the minimum number of       times he will have to use his other hand. Otherwise, print       ""-1"" (without the quotes).","In the first sample the symbol ""A"" is impossible to print as       there's no ""Shift"" key on the keyboard. In the second sample the symbol ""e"" is impossible to print as       there's no such key on the keyboard. In the fourth sample the symbols ""T"", ""G"" are impossible to print       with one hand. The other letters that are on the keyboard can be       printed. Those symbols come up in the text twice, thus, the answer       is 2."
89,"Vasya writes his own library for building graphical user       interface. Vasya called his creation VTK (VasyaToolKit). One of the       interesting aspects of this library is that widgets are packed in       each other.  A widget is some element of graphical interface. Each widget has       width and height, and occupies some rectangle on the screen. Any       widget in Vasya's library is of type Widget. For simplicity we will       identify the widget and its type.  Types HBox and VBox are derivatives of type         Widget, so they also are       types Widget. Widgets HBox and VBox are special. They can store       other widgets. Both those widgets can use the pack() method to pack directly in       itself some other widget. Widgets of types HBox and VBox can store several other       widgets, even several equal widgets — they will simply appear       several times. As a result of using the method pack() only the link to the       packed widget is saved, that is when the packed widget is changed,       its image in the widget, into which it is packed, will also       change.  We shall assume that the widget  a is packed in the widget  b if there exists a chain of widgets  a = c 1, c 2, ..., c  k = b,  k ≥ 2, for which  c  i is packed directly to  c  i + 1 for any 1 ≤ i < k. In Vasya's       library the situation when the widget  a is packed in the widget  a (that is, in itself) is not allowed. If you try       to pack the widgets into each other in this manner immediately       results in an error. Also, the widgets HBox and         VBox have parameters         border and spacing, which are determined by       the methods set_border()       and set_spacing()       respectively. By default both of these options equal 0.  The picture above shows how the widgets are packed into HBox and VBox. At that HBox and VBox automatically change their       size depending on the size of packed widgets. As for HBox and VBox, they only differ in that in         HBox the widgets are       packed horizontally and in VBox — vertically. The parameter         spacing sets the distance       between adjacent widgets, and border — a frame around all       packed widgets of the desired width. Packed widgets are placed       exactly in the order in which the pack() method was called for       them. If within HBox or         VBox there are no packed       widgets, their sizes are equal to 0 × 0, regardless of the options border and spacing.  The construction of all the widgets is performed using a       scripting language VasyaScript. The description of       the language can be found in the input data.  For the final verification of the code Vasya asks you to write a       program that calculates the sizes of all the widgets on the source       code in the language of VasyaScript. ","The first line contains an integer  n — the number of instructions (1 ≤ n ≤ 100). Next  n lines contain instructions in the language VasyaScript — one instruction per       line. There is a list of possible instructions below.  All instructions are written without spaces at the beginning and       at the end of the string. The words inside the instruction are       separated by exactly one space. There are no spaces directly       before the numbers and directly after them.  The case matters, for example, ""wiDget x"" is not a correct       instruction. The case of the letters is correct in the input data. All names of the widgets consist of lowercase Latin letters and       has the length from 1 to 10 characters inclusive. The names of all       widgets are pairwise different. All numbers in the script are       integers from 0 to 100 inclusive It is guaranteed that the above-given script is correct, that is       that all the operations with the widgets take place after the       widgets are created and no widget is packed in itself. It is       guaranteed that the script creates at least one widget. ","For each widget print on a single line its name, width and       height, separated by spaces. The lines must be ordered       lexicographically by a widget's name.  Please, do not use the %lld specificator to read or       write 64-bit integers in C++.

In other words, a letter should only be       crossed out if and only if the corresponding column or row       contains at least one more letter that is exactly the same.       Besides, all such letters are crossed out simultaneously. When all repeated letters have been crossed out, we should write       the remaining letters in a string.

Unfortunately, author's         solution of the original problem appeared wrong, so the problem         was changed specially for the archive. Once upon a time in a far away kingdom lived the King. The King       had a beautiful daughter, Victoria. They lived happily, but not       happily ever after: one day a vicious dragon attacked the kingdom       and stole Victoria. The King was full of grief, yet he gathered       his noble knights and promised half of his kingdom and Victoria's       hand in marriage to the one who will save the girl from the       infernal beast. Having travelled for some time, the knights found the dragon's       lair and all of them rushed there to save Victoria. Each knight       spat on the dragon once and, as the dragon had quite a fragile and       frail heart, his heart broke and poor beast died. As for the noble       knights, they got Victoria right to the King and started brawling       as each one wanted the girl's hand in marriage. The problem was that all the noble knights were equally noble and       equally handsome, and Victoria didn't want to marry any of them       anyway. Then the King (and he was a very wise man and didn't want       to hurt anybody's feelings) decided to find out who will get his       daughter randomly, i.e. tossing a coin. However, there turned out       to be  n noble knights and the coin only has two sides.       The good thing is that when a coin is tossed, the coin falls on       each side with equal probability. The King got interested how to       pick one noble knight using this coin so that all knights had       equal probability of being chosen (the probability in that case       should always be equal to 1 / n). First the King wants to       know the expected number of times he will need to toss a coin to       determine the winner.

Of course, right now Vasya can only think       of one thing: what the result of his talk with the examiner will be... To prepare for the exam, one has to study proofs of  n theorems. It is known that there will be  k examination cards on the exam and each card       contains        distinct theorems. Besides, no theorem is mentioned in more than       one card (that is,        theorems won't be mentioned in any card). During the exam several       students may get the same card. We do not know the exact way theorems are distributed by cards,       however the students that took the exam before Vasya told him what       theorems their cards contained. Vasya evaluates his level of proficiency in the            i-th theorem by some number  a  i.

String  x is lexicographically less than string  y, if either  x is a prefix of  y (and  x ≠ y), or there exists such  i (1 ≤ i ≤ min(|x|, |y|)),       that  x  i < y  i, and for any  j (1 ≤ j < i)  x  j = y  j. Here |a| denotes the length of the       string  a. The lexicographic comparison of strings is       implemented by operator < in modern programming languages​​. The teacher gave Anna and Maria homework. She gave them a string       of length  n. They should write out all substrings of the       given string, including the whole initial string, and the equal       substrings (for example, one should write out the following       substrings from the string ""aab"": ""a"", ""a"", ""aa"", ""ab"", ""aab"", ""b""). The resulting strings       should be sorted in the lexicographical order. The cunning teacher       doesn't want to check all these strings. That's why she said to       find only the  k-th string from the list. Help Anna and Maria do       the homework.","The first line contains a non-empty string that only consists of       small Latin letters (""a""-""z""), whose length does not       exceed 105. The second line contains the       only integer  k (1 ≤ k ≤ 105).","Print the string Anna and Maria need — the  k-th (in the lexicographical order) substring of       the given string.

129,"Anna and Maria are in charge of the math club for junior       students. When the club gathers together, the students behave       badly. They've brought lots of shoe laces to the club and got tied       with each other. Specifically, each string ties together two       students. Besides, if two students are tied, then the lace       connects the first student with the second one as well as the       second student with the first one. To restore order, Anna and Maria do the following. First, for       each student Anna finds out what other students he is tied to. If       a student is tied to exactly one other student, Anna reprimands       him. Then Maria gathers in a single group all the students who have been       just reprimanded. She kicks them out from the club. This group of       students immediately leaves the club. These students takes with       them the laces that used to tie them. Then again for every student       Anna finds out how many other students he is tied to and so on.       And they do so until Anna can reprimand at least one student. Determine how many groups of students will be kicked out of the club.","The first line contains two integers  n and  m — the initial number of students and laces ().

It is guaranteed that no two students are tied with more than one       lace. No lace ties a student to himself.",Print the single number — the number of groups of students that       will be kicked out from the club.,"In the first sample Anna and Maria won't kick out any group of       students — in the initial position every student is tied to two       other students and Anna won't be able to reprimand anyone. In the second sample four students are tied in a chain and two       more are running by themselves. First Anna and Maria kick out the       two students from both ends of the chain (1 and 4), then — two       other students from the chain (2 and 3). At that the students who       are running by themselves will stay in the club.

Help the agency and write the program that will find the       sought number by the given sequence  t 1, t 2, ..., t  n. For example, if  t = (1,  - 1, 1,  - 1), then any two elements          t  i and  t  j form a couple if  i and  j have different parity. Consequently, in this       case the sought number equals 4.

132,"Piet is one of the most known visual esoteric programming       languages. The programs in Piet are constructed from colorful       blocks of pixels and interpreted using pretty complicated rules.       In this problem we will use a subset of Piet language with       simplified rules. The program will be a rectangular image consisting of colored and       black pixels. The color of each pixel will be given by an integer       number between 0 and 9, inclusive, with 0 denoting black. A block       of pixels is defined as a rectangle of pixels of the same color       (not black). It is guaranteed that all connected groups of colored       pixels of the same color will form rectangular blocks. Groups of       black pixels can form arbitrary shapes. The program is interpreted using movement of instruction pointer       (IP) which consists of three parts: Initially BP points to the block which contains the top-left       corner of the program, DP points to the right, and CP points to       the left (see the orange square on the image below). One step of program interpretation changes the state of IP in a       following way. The interpreter finds the furthest edge of the       current color block in the direction of the DP. From all pixels       that form this edge, the interpreter selects the furthest one in       the direction of CP. After       this, BP attempts to move from this pixel into the next one in the       direction of DP. If the next pixel belongs to a colored block,       this block becomes the current one, and two other parts of IP stay       the same. It the next pixel is black or outside of the program, BP       stays the same but two other parts of IP change. If CP was       pointing to the left, now it points to the right, and DP stays the       same. If CP was pointing to the right, now it points to the left,       and DP is rotated 90 degrees clockwise. This way BP will never point to a black block (it is guaranteed       that top-left pixel of the program will not be black). You are given a Piet program. You have to figure out which block       of the program will be current after  n steps.","The first line of the input contains two integer numbers  m (1 ≤ m ≤ 50) and  n (1 ≤ n ≤ 5·107).

After step       1 block 2 becomes current one and stays it after two more steps.       After step 4 BP moves to block 3, after step 7 — to block 4, and       finally after step 10 BP returns to block 1. The sequence of states of IP is shown on the image: the arrows       are traversed clockwise, the main arrow shows direction of DP, the       side one — the direction of CP."
133,"Unary is a minimalistic Brainfuck dialect in which programs are       written using only one token.

Unlike       other modern computers, ""Ternatron IV"" operates with       ternary and not binary logic. Petya immediately wondered how the          xor operation is performed on this computer (and       whether there is anything like it). It turned out that the operation does exist (however, it is       called  tor) and it works like this. Suppose that we need       to calculate the value of the expression  a tor b. Both numbers  a and  b are written in the ternary notation one under       the other one ( b under  a). If they have a different number of digits,       then leading zeroes are added to the shorter number until the       lengths are the same. Then the numbers are summed together digit       by digit.

143,"For some time the program of rounding numbers that had been       developed by the Codeforces participants during one of the       previous rounds, helped the citizens of Far Far Away to convert       numbers into a more easily readable format. However, as time went       by, the economy of the Far Far Away developed and the scale of       operations grew. So the King ordered to found the Bank of Far Far       Away and very soon even the rounding didn't help to quickly       determine even the order of the numbers involved in operations.       Besides, rounding a number to an integer wasn't very convenient as       a bank needed to operate with all numbers with accuracy of up to         0.01, and not up to an integer. The King issued yet another order: to introduce financial format       to represent numbers denoting amounts of money. The formal rules       of storing a number in the financial format are as follows:  For example, by the above given rules number 2012 will be stored       in the financial format as ""$2,012.00"" and number       -12345678.9 will be stored as ""($12,345,678.90)"".

152,"One day Vasya went out for a walk in the yard but there weren't       any of his friends outside and he had no one to play touch and       run. But the boy didn't lose the high spirits and decided to play       touch and run with himself. You may ask: ""How did he do       that?"" The answer is simple. Vasya noticed that the yard is a rectangular  n × m field. The squares have coordinates         (x, y) (1 ≤ x ≤ n, 1 ≤ y ≤ m),       where  x is the index of the row and  y is the index of the column. Initially Vasya stands in the square with coordinates ( x  c, y  c). To play, he has got a list of  k vectors (dx  i, dy  i) of non-zero length. The game goes like       this. The boy considers all vectors in the order from 1 to  k, and consecutively chooses each vector as the       current one. After the boy has chosen a current vector, he makes       the maximally possible number of valid steps in the vector's       direction (it is possible that he makes zero steps). A step is defined as one       movement from the square where the boy is standing now, in the       direction of the current vector. That is, if Vasya is positioned       in square (x, y), and       the current vector is (dx, dy), one step moves       Vasya to square (x + dx, y + dy).       A step is considered valid,       if the boy does not go out of the yard if he performs the step. Vasya stepped on and on, on and on until he ran out of vectors in       his list. Ha had been stepping for so long that he completely       forgot how many steps he had made. Help the boy and count how many       steps he had made.","The first input line contains two integers  n and  m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 109) — the yard's sizes.

After the playing the card is discarded. More formally: let's say that there is a counter of the cards       that can be played. At the beginning of the round the counter       equals one. When a card is played, the counter decreases by one       for the played card and increases by the number  b  i, which is written at the bottom of the       card. Then the played card is discarded. If after that the counter       is not equal to zero, the player gets the opportunity to play       another card from the remaining cards. The round ends when the       counter reaches zero or the player runs out of cards. Of course, Ilya wants to get as many points as possible.

160,"Each of you probably has your personal experience of riding       public transportation and buying tickets. After a person buys a       ticket (which traditionally has an even number of digits), he       usually checks whether the ticket is lucky. Let us remind you that       a ticket is lucky if the sum of digits in its first half matches       the sum of digits in its second half. But of course, not every ticket can be lucky. Far from it!       Moreover, sometimes one look at a ticket can be enough to say       right away that the ticket is not lucky. So, let's consider the       following unluckiness       criterion that can definitely determine an unlucky ticket.       We'll say that a ticket is definitely unlucky if each digit from       the first half corresponds to some digit from the second half so       that each digit from the first half is strictly less than the       corresponding digit from the second one or each digit from the       first half is strictly more       than the corresponding digit from the second one. Each digit       should be used exactly once in the comparisons. In other words,       there is such bijective       correspondence between the digits of the first and the       second half of the ticket, that either each digit of the first       half turns out strictly       less than the corresponding digit of the second half or       each digit of the first half turns out strictly more than the       corresponding digit from the second half. For example, ticket 2421 meets the       following unluckiness criterion and will not be considered lucky       (the sought correspondence is 2 > 1 and 4 > 2), ticket 0135 also meets the criterion (the sought       correspondence is 0 < 3 and 1 < 5), and ticket 3754 does not meet the criterion.

If there are several       items with the same minimum price, the discount is available for       only one of them! Polycarpus has  k carts, and he wants to buy up all stools and       pencils from the supermarket. Help him distribute the stools and       the pencils among the shopping carts, so that the items' total       price (including the discounts) is the least possible.

The lemmings are going to jump       at sunset, and there's not much time left. Each lemming is characterized by its climbing speed of  v  i meters per minute and its weight  m  i. This means that the  i-th lemming can climb to the  j-th ledge in  minutes.

164,"Polycarpus enjoys studying Berland hieroglyphs. Once Polycarp got       hold of two ancient Berland pictures, on each of which was drawn a       circle of hieroglyphs. We know that no hieroglyph occurs twice in       either the first or the second circle (but in can occur once in       each of them). Polycarpus wants to save these pictures on his laptop, but the       problem is, laptops do not allow to write hieroglyphs circles. So       Polycarp had to break each circle and write down all of its       hieroglyphs in a clockwise order in one line. A line obtained from       the first circle will be called  a, and the line obtained from the second one will       be called  b. There are quite many ways to break hieroglyphic circles, so       Polycarpus chooses the method, that makes the length of the       largest substring of string  a, which occurs as a subsequence in string  b, maximum. Help Polycarpus — find the maximum possible length of the desired       substring (subsequence) if the first and the second circles are       broken optimally.

The remaining lines are common, and       determine the effect of the spell. You came across the text of some spell. Spell was too long, so       you cannot understand its meaning. So you want to make it as short       as possible without changing the meaning. The only way to shorten a spell that you know is the removal of       some spaces and line breaks. We know that when it comes to texts       of spells, the spaces carry meaning only in the amplifying lines,       so we should remove all spaces in other lines. Newlines also do       not matter, unless any of the two separated lines is amplifying.       Thus, if two consecutive lines are not amplifying, they need to be       joined into one (i.e. we should concatenate the second line to the       first one). Removing spaces in amplifying lines and concatenating       the amplifying lines to anything is forbidden. Note that empty lines must be processed just like all the others:       they must be joined to the adjacent non-amplifying lines, or       preserved in the output, if they are surrounded with amplifying       lines on both sides (i.e. the line above it, if there is one, is       amplifying, and the line below it, if there is one, is amplifying too). For now those are the only instructions for removing unnecessary       characters that you have to follow (oh yes, a newline is a       character, too). The input contains the text of the spell, which should be       reduced. Remove the extra characters and print the result to the output.","The input contains multiple lines. All characters in the lines       have codes from 32 to 127 (inclusive). Please note that the lines       may begin with or end with one or more spaces. The size of the       input does not exceed 1048576 ( = 220) bytes. Newlines are included       in this size. In the Windows operating system used on the testing computer, a       newline is a sequence of characters with codes #13#10. It is       guaranteed that after each line of input there is a newline. In       particular, the input ends with a newline. Note that the newline       is the end of the line, and not the beginning of the next one. It is guaranteed that the input contains at least one character       other than a newline. It is recommended to organize the input-output line by line, in       this case the newlines will be processed correctly by the language means.","Print the text of the spell where all extra characters are       deleted. Please note that each output line should be followed by a newline. Please be careful: your answers will be validated by comparing       them to the jury's answer byte-by-byte. So, all spaces and       newlines matter.","In the first sample the amplifying lines are lines 1 and 7. So,       lines 2 to 6 are concatenated to each other, all spaces are       deleted from them. In the second sample the amplifying lines are lines 1 and 3. So,       no lines are concatenated to each other. "

172,"Polycarpus has recently got interested in sequences of       pseudorandom numbers. He learned that many programming languages       generate such sequences in a similar way:        (for  i ≥ 1).

173,"""The Chamber of Secrets has been opened again"" — this       news has spread all around Hogwarts and some of the students have       been petrified due to seeing the basilisk. Dumbledore got fired       and now Harry is trying to enter the Chamber of Secrets. These       aren't good news for Lord Voldemort. The problem is, he doesn't       want anybody to be able to enter the chamber. The Dark Lord is       going to be busy sucking life out of Ginny. The Chamber of Secrets is an  n × m rectangular grid in which some of the       cells are columns. A light ray (and a basilisk's gaze) passes       through the columns without changing its direction. But with some       spell we can make a column magic to reflect the light ray (or the       gaze) in all four directions when it receives the ray. This is       shown in the figure below. The basilisk is located at the right side of the lower right cell       of the grid and is looking to the left (in the direction of the       lower left cell). According to the legend, anyone who meets a       basilisk's gaze directly dies immediately. But if someone meets a       basilisk's gaze through a column, this person will get petrified.       We know that the door to the Chamber is located on the left side       of the upper left corner of the grid and anyone who wants to enter       will look in the direction of its movement (in the direction of       the upper right cell) from that position. Given the dimensions of the chamber and the location of regular       columns, Lord Voldemort has asked you to find the minimum number       of columns that we need to make magic so that anyone who wants to       enter the chamber would be petrified or just declare that it's       impossible to secure the chamber.","The first line of the input contains two integer numbers  n and  m (2 ≤ n, m ≤ 1000).

180,"Vasya studies divisibility rules at school. Here are some of them: Vasya got interested by the fact that some divisibility rules       resemble each other. In fact, to check a number's divisibility by         2, 4, 5, 8 and 10 it       is enough to check fulfiling some condition for one or several       last digits. Vasya calls such rules the  2-type rules. If checking divisibility means finding a sum of digits and       checking whether the sum is divisible by the given number, then       Vasya calls this rule the  3-type rule (because it       works for numbers 3 and 9). If we need to find the difference between the sum of digits on       odd and even positions and check whether the difference is       divisible by the given divisor, this rule is called the  11-type rule (it works for       number 11). In some cases we should divide the divisor into several factors       and check whether rules of different types (2-type, 3-type or 11-type) work there. For example, for       number 6 we check 2-type and 3-type rules, for number 66 we check all three types. Such mixed       divisibility rules are called  6-type rules.  And finally, there are some numbers for which no rule works:       neither 2-type, nor 3-type, nor 11-type, nor 6-type. The least such number is number         7, so we'll say that in such cases       the mysterious  7-type rule works, the one       that Vasya hasn't discovered yet.  Vasya's dream is finding divisibility rules for all possible       numbers. He isn't going to stop on the decimal numbers only. As       there are quite many numbers, ha can't do it all by himself. Vasya       asked you to write a program that determines the divisibility rule       type in the  b-based notation for the given divisor  d.","The first input line contains two integers  b and  d (2 ≤ b, d ≤ 100) — the       notation system base and the divisor. Both numbers are given in       the decimal notation.","On the first output line print the type of the rule in the  b-based notation system, where the divisor is          d: ""2-type"", ""3-type"", ""11-type"", ""6-type"" or ""7-type"". If there are       several such types, print the one that goes earlier in the given       sequence. If a number belongs to the 2-type, print on the second line the least       number of the last  b-based digits that we will need to use to check       the divisibility.","The divisibility rule for number 3       in binary notation looks as follows: ""A number is divisible       by 3 if and only if the sum of its       digits that occupy the even places differs from the sum of digits       that occupy the odd places, in a number that is divisible by 3"". That's an 11-type rule. For example, 2110 = 101012. For it the sum of digits on       odd positions equals 1 + 1 + 1 = 3,       an on even positions — 0 + 0 = 0.       The rule works and the number is divisible by 3.  In some notations a number can fit into the 3-type rule and the 11-type rule. In this case the correct       answer is ""3-type""."

182,"Vasya lives in a strange world. The year has  n months and the  i-th month has  a  i days. Vasya got a New Year present — the       clock that shows not only the time, but also the date. The clock's face can display any number from 1 to  d. It is guaranteed that  a  i ≤ d for all  i from 1 to  n. The clock does not keep information about the       current month, so when a new day comes, it simply increases the       current day number by one. The clock cannot display number  d + 1, so after day number  d it shows day 1       (the current day counter resets). The mechanism of the clock       allows you to increase the day number by one manually. When you       execute this operation, day  d is also followed by day 1. Vasya begins each day checking the day number on the clock. If       the day number on the clock does not match the actual day number       in the current month, then Vasya manually increases it by one.

183,"The Zoo in the Grid Kingdom is represented by an infinite grid.       The Zoo has  n observation binoculars located at the  OX axis. For each  i between 1 and          n, inclusive, there exists a single binocular       located at the point with coordinates (i, 0). There are  m flamingos in the Zoo, located at points with       positive coordinates. The flamingos are currently sleeping and you       can assume that they don't move. In order to get a good view over the flamingos, each of the       binoculars can be independently rotated to face any angle (not       necessarily integer). Then, the binocular can be used to observe       all flamingos that is located at the straight line passing through       the binocular at the angle it is set. In other words, you can       assign each binocular a direction corresponding to any straight       line passing through the binocular, and the binocular will be able       to see all flamingos located on that line. Today, some kids from the prestigious Codeforces kindergarten       went on a Field Study to the Zoo.

185,"As you very well know, the whole Universe traditionally uses       three-dimensional Cartesian system of coordinates. In this system       each point corresponds to three real coordinates (x, y, z). In this       coordinate system, the distance between the center of the Universe       and the point is calculated by the following formula: .       Mushroom scientists that work for the Great Mushroom King think       that the Universe isn't exactly right and the distance from the       center of the Universe to a point equals  x  a·y  b·z  c.

186,"Each year in the castle of Dwarven King there is a competition in       growing mushrooms among the dwarves. The competition is one of the       most prestigious ones, and the winner gets a wooden salad bowl.       This year's event brought together the best mushroom growers from       around the world, so we had to slightly change the rules so that       the event gets more interesting to watch. Each mushroom grower has a mushroom that he will grow on the       competition. Under the new rules, the competition consists of two       parts. The first part lasts  t 1 seconds and the second       part lasts  t 2 seconds. The first and       the second part are separated by a little break. After the starting whistle the first part of the contest starts,       and all mushroom growers start growing mushrooms at once, each at       his individual speed of  v  i meters per second. After  t 1 seconds, the mushroom       growers stop growing mushrooms and go to have a break. During the       break, for unexplained reasons, the growth of all mushrooms is       reduced by  k percent. After the break the second part of the       contest starts and all mushrooms growers at the same time continue       to grow mushrooms, each at his individual speed of  u  i meters per second. After a  t 2 seconds after the end of       the break, the competition ends. Note that the speeds before and       after the break may vary. Before the match dwarf Pasha learned from all participants, what       two speeds they have chosen. However, the participants did not       want to disclose to him all their strategy and therefore, did not       say in what order they will be using these speeds. That is, if a       participant chose speeds  a  i and  b  i, then there are two strategies: he       either uses speed  a  i before the break and speed  b  i after it, or vice versa. Dwarf Pasha really wants to win the totalizer. He knows that each       participant chooses the strategy that maximizes the height of the       mushroom. Help Dwarf Pasha make the final table of competition results. The participants are sorted in the result table by the mushroom       height (the participants with higher mushrooms follow earlier in       the table). In case of equal mushroom heights, the participants       are sorted by their numbers (the participants with a smaller       number follow earlier).","The first input line contains four integer numbers  n,  t 1,  t 2,  k (1 ≤ n, t 1, t 2 ≤ 1000; 1 ≤ k ≤ 100) —       the number of participants, the time before the break, the time       after the break and the percentage, by which the mushroom growth       drops during the break, correspondingly.

He decides to choose a competition that also exhibits       algorithmic features. AlgoRace is a special league of car racing where different teams       compete in a country of  n cities. Cities are numbered 1 through  n. Every two distinct cities in the country are       connected with one bidirectional road. Each competing team should       introduce one driver and a set of cars. The competition is held in  r rounds. In  i-th round, drivers will start at city  s  i and finish at city  t  i. Drivers are allowed to change their       cars at most  k  i times. Changing cars can take place in       any city in no time. One car can be used multiple times in one       round, but total number of changes should not exceed  k  i. Drivers can freely choose their path to destination. PMP has prepared  m type of purpose-built cars. Beside for PMP’s       driving skills, depending on properties of the car and the road, a       car traverses each road in each direction in different times.

190,"So, the Berland is at war with its eternal enemy Flatland again,       and Vasya, an accountant, was assigned to fulfil his duty to the       nation.  Right now the situation in Berland is dismal — their both cities       are surrounded! The armies of flatlanders stand on the borders of       circles, the circles' centers are in the surrounded cities. At any       moment all points of the flatland ring can begin to move quickly       in the direction of the city — that's the strategy the flatlanders       usually follow when they besiege cities. The berlanders are sure that they can repel the enemy's attack if       they learn the exact time the attack starts. For that they need to       construct a radar that would register any movement at the distance       of at most  r from it. Thus, we can install a radar at such       point, that at least one point of the enemy ring will be in its       detecting range (that is, at a distance of at most  r). Then the radar can immediately inform about       the enemy's attack.  Due to the newest technologies, we can place a radar at any point       without any problems. But the problem is that the berlanders have       the time to make only one radar. Besides, the larger the detection       radius (r) is, the more the       radar costs. That's why Vasya's task (that is, your task) is to find the       minimum possible detection radius for the radar. In other words,       your task is to find the minimum radius  r (r ≥ 0)       such, that a radar with radius  r can be installed at some point and it can       register the start of the       movements of both flatland rings from that point.  In this problem you can consider the cities as material points,       the attacking enemy rings - as circles with centers in the cities,       the radar's detection range — as a disk (including the border)       with the center at the point where the radar is placed.","The input files consist of two lines.

Berland       opposition, led by Mr. Ovalny, believes that the elections were       not fair enough and wants to organize a demonstration at one of       the squares. Bertown has  n squares, numbered from 1 to  n, they are numbered in the order of increasing       distance between them and the city center. That is, square number         1 is central, and square number          n is the farthest from the center. Naturally, the       opposition wants to hold a meeting as close to the city center as       possible (that is, they want an square with the minimum number). There are exactly  k (k < n) days left before       the demonstration. Now all squares are free. But the Bertown city       administration never sleeps, and the approval of an application       for the demonstration threatens to become a very complex process.       The process of approval lasts several days, but every day the       following procedure takes place: In order to organize an event on the square  i, the administration needs to spend  a  i bourles. Because of the crisis the       administration has only  b bourles to confront the opposition. What is the       best square that the opposition can take, if the administration       will keep trying to occupy the square in question each time?

In the second sample the opposition has only the chance for the       last square. If its first move occupies one of the first four       squares, the administration is left with at least 4 bourles, which       means that next day it can use its next move to move the       opposition from any square to the last one.

192,"In Berland the opposition is going to arrange mass walking on the       boulevard. The boulevard consists of  n tiles that are lain in a row and are numbered       from 1 to  n from right to left. The opposition should start       walking on the tile number 1 and the       finish on the tile number  n. During the walk it is allowed to move from       right to left between adjacent tiles in a row, and jump over a       tile. More formally, if you are standing on the tile number  i (i < n - 1), you can       reach the tiles number  i + 1 or the tile number  i + 2 from it (if you stand on the tile number          n - 1, you can only reach tile number  n). We can assume that all the opposition       movements occur instantaneously. In order to thwart an opposition rally, the Berland bloody regime       organized the rain.

The canyon gets flooded and each second the water level raises       one meter. Initially the water level is at the lower border of the       first area. Ninja cannot be on the area covered by water. We can       assume that the ninja and the water ""move in turns"" —       first the ninja performs some action, then the water raises for       one meter, then the ninja performs one more action and so on. The level is considered completed if the ninja manages to get out       of the canyon. After several failed attempts Vasya started to doubt whether it       is possible to complete the level at all. Help him answer the question.","The first line contains two integers  n and  k (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 105) — the height of the canyon and       the height of ninja's jump, correspondingly. The second line contains the description of the left wall — a       string with the length of  n characters. The  i-th character represents the state of the  i-th wall area: character ""X"" represents a dangerous       area and character ""-"" represents a safe area. The third line describes the right wall in the same format. It is guaranteed that the first area of the left wall is not dangerous.","Print ""YES""       (without the quotes) if the ninja can get out from the canyon,       otherwise, print ""NO"" (without the quotes).","In the first sample the ninja should first jump to the right       wall, then go one meter down along the right wall, then jump to       the left wall.

199,"A renowned abstract artist Sasha, drawing inspiration from       nowhere, decided to paint a picture entitled ""Special       Olympics"". He justly thought that, if the regular Olympic       games have five rings, then the Special ones will do with exactly       two rings just fine. Let us remind you that a ring is a region located between two       concentric circles with radii  r and  R (r < R). These radii are       called internal and external, respectively. Concentric circles are       circles with centers located at the same point. Soon a white canvas, which can be considered as an infinite       Cartesian plane, had two perfect rings, painted with solid black       paint. As Sasha is very impulsive, the rings could have different       radii and sizes, they intersect and overlap with each other in any       way. We know only one thing for sure: the centers of the pair of       rings are not the same. When Sasha got tired and fell into a deep sleep, a girl called       Ilona came into the room and wanted to cut a circle for the sake       of good memories. To make the circle beautiful, she decided to cut       along the contour. We'll consider a contour to be a continuous closed line through       which there is transition from one color to another (see notes for       clarification). If the contour takes the form of a circle, then       the result will be cutting out a circle, which Iona wants. But the girl's inquisitive mathematical mind does not rest: how       many ways are there to cut a circle out of the canvas?","The input contains two lines.  Each line has four space-separated integers  x  i,  y  i,  r  i,  R  i, that describe the  i-th ring;  x  i and  y  i are coordinates of the ring's center,          r  i and  R  i are the internal and external radii of       the ring correspondingly ( - 100 ≤ x  i, y  i ≤ 100; 1 ≤ r  i < R  i ≤ 100).

201,"A widely known among some people Belarusian sport programmer Yura       possesses lots of information about cars. That is why he has been       invited to participate in a game show called ""Guess That Car!"". The game show takes place on a giant parking lot, which is 4n meters long from north to south       and 4m meters wide from west       to east. The lot has  n + 1 dividing lines drawn from west to east and          m + 1 dividing lines drawn from north to south,       which divide the parking lot into  n·m 4 by         4 meter squares. There is a car       parked strictly inside each square. The dividing lines are       numbered from 0 to  n from north to south and from 0 to  m from west to east. Each square has coordinates         (i, j) so that the       square in the north-west corner has coordinates (1, 1) and the square in the south-east       corner has coordinates (n, m). See the picture in       the notes for clarifications. Before the game show the organizers offer Yura to occupy any of       the (n + 1)·(m + 1)       intersection points of the dividing lines. After that he can start       guessing the cars. After Yura chooses a point, he will be       prohibited to move along the parking lot before the end of the       game show. As Yura is a car expert, he will always guess all cars       he is offered, it's just a matter of time. Yura knows that to       guess each car he needs to spend time equal to the square of the       euclidean distance between his point and the center of the square       with this car, multiplied by some coefficient characterizing the       machine's ""rarity"" (the rarer the car is, the harder it       is to guess it). More formally, guessing a car with       ""rarity""  c placed in a square whose center is at distance          d from Yura takes  c·d 2 seconds. The time Yura       spends on turning his head can be neglected. It just so happened that Yura knows the ""rarity"" of       each car on the parking lot in advance. Help him choose his point       so that the total time of guessing all cars is the smallest possible.","The first line contains two integers  n and  m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 1000) — the       sizes of the parking lot.

But there's a problem — a       severe torcoder coordinator Ivan does not accept any Lesha's       problem, calling each of them an offensive word ""duped""       (that is, duplicated). And one day they nearely quarrelled over       yet another problem Ivan wouldn't accept.

227,"Once at a team training Vasya, Petya and Sasha got a problem on       implementing linear search in an array. According to the boys, linear search works as follows. The array       elements in a pre-selected order are in turn compared with the       number that you need to find. Once you find the array element that       is equal to the required one, the search ends. The efficiency of       the algorithm is the number of performed comparisons. The fewer       comparisons the linear search has made, the more effective it is. Vasya believes that a linear search would work better if it       sequentially iterates through the elements, starting with the         1-st one (in this problem we       consider the elements of the array indexed from 1 to  n) and ending with the  n-th one. And Petya says that Vasya is wrong: the       search will need less comparisons if it sequentially iterates the       elements starting from the  n-th and ending with the 1-st one. Sasha argues that the two       approaches are equivalent. To finally begin the task, the teammates decided to settle the       debate and compare the two approaches on an example. For this,       they took an array that is a permutation of integers from 1 to  n, and generated  m queries of the form: find element with value          b  i in the array. They want to calculate for       both approaches how many comparisons in total the linear search       will need to respond to all queries. If the first search needs       fewer comparisons, then the winner of the dispute is Vasya. If the       second one does, then the winner is Petya. If both approaches make       the same number of comparisons, then Sasha's got the upper hand. But the problem is, linear search is too slow.

229,"Goa'uld Apophis captured Jack O'Neill's team again! Jack himself       was able to escape, but by that time Apophis's ship had already       jumped to hyperspace. But Jack knows on what planet will Apophis       land. In order to save his friends, Jack must repeatedly go       through stargates to get to this planet. Overall the galaxy has  n planets, indexed with numbers from 1 to  n. Jack is on the planet with index 1, and Apophis       will land on the planet with index  n. Jack can move between some pairs of planets       through stargates (he can move in both directions); the transfer       takes a positive, and, perhaps, for different pairs of planets       unequal number of seconds. Jack begins his journey at time 0. It can be that other travellers are arriving to the planet where       Jack is currently located. In this case, Jack has to wait for       exactly 1 second before he can use the stargate. That is, if at       time  t another traveller arrives to the planet, Jack       can only pass through the stargate at time  t + 1, unless there are more travellers arriving       at time  t + 1 to the same planet. Knowing the information about travel times between the planets,       and the times when Jack would not be able to use the stargate on       particular planets, determine the minimum time in which he can get       to the planet with index  n.","The first line contains two space-separated integers:  n (2 ≤ n ≤ 105), the number of planets in the       galaxy, and  m (0 ≤ m ≤ 105) — the number of pairs of       planets between which Jack can travel using stargates.

The street, where the Lou Who family lives can be represented as          n consecutive sections of equal length. You can go       from any section to a neighbouring one in one unit of time. Each       of the sections is one of three types: an empty piece of land, a       house or a shop. Cindy Lou and her family can buy sweets in a       shop, but no more than one kilogram of sweets in one shop (the       vendors care about the residents of Whoville not to overeat on sweets).

250,"An IPv6-address is a 128-bit number. For convenience, this number       is recorded in blocks of 16 bits in hexadecimal record, the blocks       are separated by colons — 8 blocks in total, each block has four       hexadecimal digits. Here is an example of the correct record of a       IPv6 address: ""0124:5678:90ab:cdef:0124:5678:90ab:cdef"".       We'll call such format of recording an IPv6-address full. Besides the full record of an IPv6 address there is a short record format. The record       of an IPv6 address can be shortened by removing one or more       leading zeroes at the beginning of each block. However, each block       should contain at least one digit in the short format. For       example, the leading zeroes can be removed like that: ""a56f:00d3:0000:0124:0001:f19a:1000:0000""          →  ""a56f:d3:0:0124:01:f19a:1000:00"".

A sequence can consist       of one or several consecutive       blocks, with all 16 bits equal to 0.  You can see examples of zero block shortenings below: It is not allowed to shorten zero blocks in the address more than       once. This means that the short record can't contain the sequence       of characters ""::"" more than once.       Otherwise, it will sometimes be impossible to determine the number       of zero blocks, each represented by a double colon.

In the Pindows operating system a strings are the lexemes of the       command line — the first of them is understood as the name of the       program to run and the following lexemes are its arguments. For       example, as we execute the command "" run.exe one, two . "", we       give four lexemes to the Pindows command line: ""run.exe"", ""one,"", ""two"", ""."". More formally, if we run       a command that can be represented as string  s (that has no quotes), then the command line       lexemes are maximal by inclusion substrings of string  s that contain no spaces. To send a string with spaces or an empty string as a command line       lexeme, we can use double quotes. The block of characters that       should be considered as one lexeme goes inside the quotes.

292," This problem uses a simplified         network topology model, please read the problem statement         carefully and use it as a formal document as you develop the solution. Polycarpus continues working as a system administrator in a large       corporation. The computer network of this corporation consists of          n computers, some of them are connected by a       cable. The computers are indexed by integers from 1 to  n. It's known that any two computers connected by       cable directly or through other computers Polycarpus decided to find out the network's topology. A network       topology is the way of describing the network configuration, the       scheme that shows the location and the connections of network devices. Polycarpus knows three main network topologies: bus, ring and       star. A bus is the topology that represents a shared cable with       all computers connected with it. In the ring topology the cable       connects each computer only with two other ones. A star is the       topology where all computers of a network are connected to the       single central node. Let's represent each of these network topologies as a connected       non-directed graph. A bus is a connected graph that is the only       path, that is, the graph where all nodes are connected with two       other ones except for some two nodes that are the beginning and       the end of the path. A ring is a connected graph, where all nodes       are connected with two other ones. A star is a connected graph,       where a single central node is singled out and connected with all       other nodes. For clarifications, see the picture. You've got a connected non-directed graph that characterizes the       computer network in Polycarpus' corporation. Help him find out,       which topology type the given network is. If that is impossible to       do, say that the network's topology is unknown.

The feeders live in hill 1. One day, the cats went out to play. Cat  i went on a trip to hill  h  i, finished its trip at time  t  i, and then waited at hill  h  i for a feeder. The feeders must take all       the cats. Each feeder goes straightly from hill 1 to  n without waiting at a hill and takes all the         waiting cats at each hill       away.

329,"You're a mikemon breeder currently in the middle of your journey       to become a mikemon master. Your current obstacle is go through       the infamous Biridian Forest.  The forest The Biridian Forest is a two-dimensional grid consisting of  r rows and  c columns. Each cell in Biridian Forest may       contain a tree, or may be vacant. A vacant cell may be occupied by       zero or more mikemon breeders (there may also be breeders other       than you in the forest). Mikemon breeders (including you) cannot       enter cells with trees. One of the cells is designated as the exit cell. The initial grid, including your initial position, the exit cell,       and the initial positions of all other breeders, will be given to       you. Here's an example of such grid (from the first example):  Moves Breeders (including you) may move in the forest. In a single       move, breeders may perform one of the following actions:  After each time you make a single move, each of the other       breeders simultaneously make a single move (the choice of which       move to make may be different for each of the breeders).  Mikemon battle If you and  t (t > 0)       mikemon breeders are located on the same cell, exactly  t mikemon battles will ensue that time (since you       will be battling each of those  t breeders once).

345,"Triskaidekaphobia is a fear of number 13. Ordinary people who       suffer from this phobia feel uncomfortable around numbers 13, 130,       513 etc, but you, being a programmer, take this fear one step       further. For example, consider number 7. It's ok when written in       decimal, but written in base 4 it becomes 13, the dreadful number! The more you think about it, the worse it looks. Number 100 has       as many as 13 notations which contain 13! And there are numbers       which have 13 in infinite number of their notations! Luckily, you       can do any math in binary, which is completely safe from the nasty       number. But still, you want to be able to estimate the level of       nastiness of any number.

Dima loves order, so he does tasks       consecutively, starting from some task. For example, if Dima has         6 tasks to do in total, then, if       he starts from the 5-th task, the       order is like that: first Dima does the 5-th task, then the 6-th one, then the 1-st one, then the 2-nd one, then the 3-rd one, then the 4-th one.

380,"Sereja adores trees. Today he came up with a revolutionary new       type of binary root trees. His new tree consists of  n levels, each vertex is indexed by two integers:       the number of the level and the number of the vertex on the       current level. The tree root is at level 1, its index is (1, 1). Here is a pseudo code of tree construction. After the pseudo code is run, cell cnt[level] contains the number of       vertices on level  level. Cell left[level][position] contains       the number of the vertex on the level  level + 1, which is the left child of the vertex       with index (level, position), or it       contains -1, if the vertex doesn't have a left child.

391," You will receive 5 points for         solving this problem. Manao has invented a new operation on strings that is called       folding. Each fold happens between a pair of consecutive letters       and places the second part of the string above first part, running       in the opposite direction and aligned to the position of the fold.       Using this operation, Manao converts the string into a structure       that has one more level than there were fold operations performed.       See the following examples for clarity. We will denote the positions of folds with '|' characters. For example, the       word ""ABRACADABRA"" written as         ""AB|RACA|DAB|RA"" indicates       that it has been folded three times: first, between the leftmost       pair of 'B' and 'R' letters; second, between         'A' and 'D'; and third, between the       rightmost pair of 'B' and         'R' letters. Here are       several examples of folded strings: One last example for ""ABCD|EFGH|IJ|K"":  Manao noticed that each folded string can be viewed as several       piles of letters. For instance, in the previous example, there are       four piles, which can be read as ""AHI"", ""BGJK"", ""CF"", and ""DE"" from bottom to top.       Manao wonders what is the highest pile of identical letters he can       build using fold operations on a given word. Note that the pile       should not contain gaps and should start at the bottom level. For       example, in the rightmost of the four examples above, none of the       piles would be considered valid since each of them has gaps,       starts above the bottom level, or both.",The input will consist of one line containing a single string of          n characters with 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000 and no spaces. All       characters of the string will be uppercase letters.  This problem doesn't have         subproblems. You will get 5 points for the correct submission.,Print a single integer — the size of the largest pile composed of       identical characters that can be seen in a valid result of folding       operations on the given string.,"Consider the first example. Manao can create a pile of three         'A's using the folding         ""AB|RACAD|ABRA"", which       results in the following structure:  In the second example, Manao can create a pile of three 'B's using the following folding:         ""AB|BB|CBDB"".  Another way for Manao to create a pile of three 'B's with ""ABBBCBDB"" is the following       folding: ""AB|B|BCBDB"".  In the third example, there are no folds performed and the string       is just written in one line."
392,"The Tower of Hanoi is a well-known mathematical puzzle. It       consists of three rods, and a number of disks of different sizes       which can slide onto any rod. The puzzle starts with the disks in       a neat stack in ascending order of size on one rod, the smallest       at the top, thus making a conical shape. The objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack to       another rod, obeying the following simple rules:  With three disks, the puzzle can be solved in seven moves.

There are a lot of       universities nowadays, so Alexey is getting lost in the diversity       — he has not yet decided what profession he wants to get. At       school, he had bad grades in all subjects, and it's only thanks to       wealthy parents that he was able to obtain the graduation certificate. The situation is complicated by the fact that each high education       institution has the determined amount of voluntary donations, paid       by the new students for admission —  n  i berubleys. He cannot pay more than  n  i, because then the difference between the       paid amount and  n  i can be regarded as a bribe! Each rector is wearing the distinctive uniform of his university.       Therefore, the uniform's pockets cannot contain coins of       denomination more than  r  i. The rector also does not carry coins of       denomination less than  l  i in his pocket — because if everyone pays       him with so small coins, they gather a lot of weight and the       pocket tears. Therefore, a donation can be paid only by coins of       denomination  x berubleys, where  l  i ≤ x ≤ r  i (Berland uses coins of any positive       integer denomination).

At each cycle each core of the processor gets one instruction:       either do nothing, or the number of the memory cell (the core will       write an information to the cell). After receiving the command,       the core executes it immediately. Sometimes it happens that at one       cycle, multiple cores try to write the information into a single       cell. Unfortunately, the developers did not foresee the       possibility of resolving conflicts between cores, so in this case       there is a deadlock: all       these cores and the corresponding memory cell are locked forever.       Each of the locked cores ignores all further commands, and no core       in the future will be able to record an information into the       locked cell.

480,"Valery is a PE teacher at a school in Berland. Soon the students       are going to take a test in long jumps, and Valery has lost his       favorite ruler!  However, there is no reason for disappointment, as Valery has       found another ruler, its length is  l centimeters. The ruler already has  n marks, with which he can make measurements. We       assume that the marks are numbered from 1 to  n in the order they appear from the beginning of       the ruler to its end. The first point coincides with the beginning       of the ruler and represents the origin. The last mark coincides       with the end of the ruler, at distance  l from the origin. This ruler can be repesented by       an increasing sequence  a 1, a 2, ..., a  n, where  a  i denotes the distance of the  i-th mark from the origin ( a 1 = 0,  a  n = l). Valery believes that with a ruler he can measure the distance of          d centimeters, if there is a pair of integers          i and  j (1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ n), such       that the distance between the  i-th and the  j-th mark is exactly equal to  d (in other words,  a  j - a  i = d).  Under the rules, the girls should be able to jump at least  x centimeters, and the boys should be able to jump       at least  y ( x < y) centimeters. To test the       children's abilities, Valery needs a ruler to measure each of the       distances  x and  y.  Your task is to determine what is the minimum number of       additional marks you need to add on the ruler so that they can be       used to measure the distances  x and  y. Valery can add the marks at any integer       non-negative distance from the origin not exceeding the length of       the ruler.","The first line contains four positive space-separated integers          n,  l,  x,  y (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 2 ≤ l ≤ 109, 1 ≤ x < y ≤ l) —       the number of marks, the length of the ruler and the jump norms       for girls and boys, correspondingly. The second line contains a sequence of  n integers  a 1, a 2, ..., a  n (0 = a 1 < a 2 < ... < a  n = l), where  a  i shows the distance from the  i-th mark to the origin.","In the first line print a single non-negative integer  v — the minimum number of marks that you need to       add on the ruler. In the second line print  v space-separated integers  p 1, p 2, ..., p  v (0 ≤ p  i ≤ l). Number  p  i means that the  i-th mark should be at the distance of  p  i centimeters from the origin. Print the       marks in any order. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.","In the first sample it is impossible to initially measure the       distance of 230 centimeters. For       that it is enough to add a 20       centimeter mark or a 230 centimeter mark. In the second sample you already can use the ruler to measure the       distances of 185 and 230 centimeters, so you don't have to add       new marks. In the third sample the ruler only contains the initial and the       final marks. We will need to add two marks to be able to test the       children's skills."

After you tell the song name, Peter immediately       plays the following song in order, and so on. The  i-th song of AC/PE has its recognizability  p  i. This means that if the song has not yet       been recognized by you, you listen to it for exactly one more       second and with probability of  p  i percent you recognize it and tell it's       name. Otherwise you continue listening it. Note that you can only       try to guess it only when it is integer number of seconds after       the moment the song starts playing. In all AC/PE songs the first words of chorus are the same as the       title, so when you've heard the first  t  i seconds of  i-th song and its chorus starts, you immediately       guess its name for sure. For example, in the song Highway To Red the chorus sounds pretty       late, but the song has high recognizability.

Each cube is associated       with the coordinates of its lower left corner, these coordinates       are integers for each cube. The figure turned out to be stable. This means that       for any cube that is not on the ground, there is at least one cube       under it such that those two cubes touch by a side or a corner. More       formally, this means that for the cube with coordinates (x, y) either  y = 0, or there is a cube with coordinates (x - 1, y - 1), (x, y - 1) or (x + 1, y - 1).

523," In this problem you will have to         deal with a real algorithm that is used in the VK social network. As in any other company that creates high-loaded websites, the VK       developers have to deal with request statistics regularly. An       important indicator reflecting the load of the site is the mean       number of requests for a certain period of time of  T seconds (for example,  T = 60 seconds = 1 min and  T = 86400 seconds = 1 day). For       example, if this value drops dramatically, that shows that the       site has access problem. If this value grows, that may be a reason       to analyze the cause for the growth and add more servers to the       website if it is really needed. However, even such a natural problem as counting the mean number       of queries for some period of time can be a challenge when you       process the amount of data of a huge social network. That's why       the developers have to use original techniques to solve problems       approximately, but more effectively at the same time. Let's consider the following formal model. We have a service that       works for  n seconds. We know the number of queries to this       resource  a  t at each moment of time  t (1 ≤ t ≤ n). Let's formulate       the following algorithm of         calculating the mean with exponential decay. Let  c be some real number, strictly larger than one. Thus, the mean variable is recalculated each second using the       number of queries that came at that second. We can make some       mathematical calculations and prove that choosing the value of       constant  c correctly will make the value of mean not very different from the       real mean value  a  x at  t - T + 1 ≤ x ≤ t.  The advantage of such approach is that it only uses the number of       requests at the current moment of time and doesn't require storing       the history of requests for a large time range. Also, it considers       the recent values with the weight larger than the weight of the       old ones, which helps to react to dramatic change in values quicker. However before using the new theoretical approach in industrial       programming, there is an obligatory step to make, that is, to test       its credibility practically on given test data sets. Your task is       to compare the data obtained as a result of the work of an       approximate algorithm to the real data.  You are given  n values  a  t, integer  T and real number  c. Also, you are given  m moments  p  j (1 ≤ j ≤ m), where we are       interested in the mean value of the number of queries for the last          T seconds. Implement two algorithms. The first one       should calculate the required value by definition, i.e. by the       formula .       The second algorithm should calculate the mean value as is       described above. Print both values and calculate the relative       error of the second algorithm by the formula ,       where  approx is the approximate value, obtained by the       second algorithm, and  real is the exact value obtained by the first algorithm.","The first line contains integer  n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·105), integer  T (1 ≤ T ≤ n) and real number          c (1 < c ≤ 100) — the time range       when the resource should work, the length of the time range during       which we need the mean number of requests and the coefficient          c of the work of approximate algorithm.

553,"Let's define the permutation of length  n as an array  p = [p 1, p 2, ..., p  n] consisting of  n distinct integers from range from 1 to  n. We say that this permutation maps value 1 into the value  p 1, value 2 into the value  p 2 and so on. Kyota Ootori has just learned about cyclic representation of a       permutation. A cycle is a       sequence of numbers such that each element of this sequence is       being mapped into the next element of this sequence (and the last       element of the cycle is being mapped into the first element of the       cycle). The cyclic       representation is a representation of  p as a collection of cycles forming  p. For example, permutation  p = [4, 1, 6, 2, 5, 3] has a cyclic representation that       looks like (142)(36)(5) because 1 is       replaced by 4, 4 is replaced by 2, 2 is replaced by 1, 3 and 6 are       swapped, and 5 remains in place.  Permutation may have several cyclic representations, so Kyoya       defines the standard cyclic       representation of a permutation as follows. First, reorder       the elements within each cycle so the largest element is first.       Then, reorder all of the cycles so they are sorted by their first       element. For our example above, the standard cyclic representation       of [4, 1, 6, 2, 5, 3] is (421)(5)(63). Now, Kyoya notices that if we drop the parenthesis in the       standard cyclic representation, we get another permutation! For       instance, [4, 1, 6, 2, 5, 3] will       become [4, 2, 1, 5, 6, 3]. Kyoya notices that some permutations don't change after applying       operation described above at all. He wrote all permutations of       length  n that do not change in a list in lexicographic       order. Unfortunately, his friend Tamaki Suoh lost this list. Kyoya       wishes to reproduce the list and he needs your help.

","The standard cycle representation is (1)(32)(4), which after removing       parenthesis gives us the original permutation.

566,"A Large Software Company develops its own social network.       Analysts have found that during the holidays, major sporting       events and other significant events users begin to enter the       network more frequently, resulting in great load increase on the infrastructure. As part of this task, we assume that the social network is 4n processes running on the  n servers. All servers are absolutely identical       machines, each of which has a volume of RAM of 1 GB = 1024       MB  (1). Each process takes       100 MB of RAM on the server. At the same time, the needs of       maintaining the viability of the server takes about 100 more megabytes of RAM. Thus, each       server may have up to 9 different       processes of social network. Now each of the  n servers is running exactly 4 processes. However, at the moment of       peak load it is sometimes necessary to replicate the existing         4n processes by creating         8n new processes instead of       the old ones. More formally, there is a set of replication rules,       the  i-th (1 ≤ i ≤ 4n) of which has the       form of  a  i → (b  i, c  i), where  a  i,  b  i and  c  i (1 ≤ a  i, b  i, c  i ≤ n) are the numbers of servers.       This means that instead of an old process running on server  a  i, there should appear two new copies of       the process running on servers  b  i and  c  i. The two new replicated processes can be       on the same server (i.e.,  b  i may be equal to  c  i) or even on the same server where the       original process was (i.e.  a  i may be equal to  b  i or  c  i). During the implementation of the rule          a  i → (b  i, c  i) first the process from the server  a  i is destroyed, then appears a process on       the server  b  i, then appears a process on the server          c  i. There is a set of 4n rules,       destroying all the original 4n processes from  n servers, and creating after their application         8n replicated processes,       besides, on each of the  n servers will be exactly 8 processes. However, the rules can only       be applied consecutively, and therefore the amount of RAM of the       servers imposes limitations on the procedure for the application       of the rules. According to this set of rules determine the order in which you       want to apply all the 4n       rules so that at any given time the memory of each of the servers       contained at most 9 processes (old       and new together), or tell that it is impossible.","The first line of the input contains integer  n (1 ≤ n ≤ 30 000) — the number of       servers of the social network.

In the first sample test the network uses two servers, each of       which initially has four launched processes. In accordance with       the rules of replication, each of the processes must be destroyed       and twice run on another server. One of the possible answers is       given in the statement: after applying rules 1 and 2 the       first server will have 2 old running       processes, and the second server will have 8 (4 old and         4 new) processes. After we apply       rules 5 and 6, both servers will have 6 running processes (2 old and 4       new). After we apply rules 3 and         7, both servers will have 7 running processes (1 old and 6       new), and after we apply rules 4 and         8, each server will have 8 running processes. At no time the number       of processes on a single server exceeds 9. In the second sample test the network uses three servers. On each       server, three processes are replicated into two processes on the       same server, and the fourth one is replicated in one process for       each of the two remaining servers. As a result of applying rules         2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12 each       server would have 7 processes (6 old and 1       new), as a result of applying rules 1, 5, 9 each server will have 8 processes.

567,"Berland National Library has recently been built in the capital       of Berland. In addition, in the library you can take any of the       collected works of Berland leaders, the library has a reading room. Today was the pilot launch of an automated reading room visitors'       accounting system! The scanner of the system is installed at the       entrance to the reading room. It records the events of the form       ""reader entered room"", ""reader left room"".       Every reader is assigned a registration number during the       registration procedure at the library — it's a unique integer from         1 to 106. Thus, the system logs events       of two forms: The first launch of the system was a success, it functioned for       some period of time, and, at the time of its launch and at the       time of its shutdown, the reading room may already have visitors. Significant funds of the budget of Berland have been spent on the       design and installation of the system. Therefore, some of the       citizens of the capital now demand to explain the need for this       system and the benefits that its implementation will bring. Now,       the developers of the system need to urgently come up with reasons       for its existence.

These relations are very       important in many areas of mathematics. For example, the equality       of the two numbers is an equivalence relation. A set ρ of pairs (a, b) of elements of some       set  A is called a binary relation on set  A. For two elements  a and  b of the set  A we say that they are in relation ρ, if pair ,       in this case we use a notation .

However, you noticed that Johnny's       ""proof"" is wrong, and decided to show him a lot of       examples that prove him wrong. Here's your task: count the number of binary relations over a set       of size  n such that they are symmetric, transitive, but       not an equivalence relations (i.e. they are not reflexive).

575,"Ruritania is a country with a very badly maintained road network,       which is not exactly good news for lorry drivers that constantly       have to do deliveries. In fact, when roads are maintained, they       become one-way. It turns       out that it is sometimes impossible to get from one town to       another in a legal way – however, we know that all towns are reachable, though illegally! Fortunately for us, the police tend to be very corrupt and they       will allow a lorry driver to break the rules and drive in the       wrong direction provided they receive ‘a small gift’. There is one       patrol car for every road and they will request 1000 Ruritanian       dinars when a driver drives in the wrong direction. However, being       greedy, every time a patrol car notices the same driver breaking       the rule, they will charge double the amount of money they       requested the previous time on that particular road.

585,"The mobile application store has a new game called ""Subway Roller"". The protagonist of the game Philip is located in one end of the       tunnel and wants to get out of the other one. The tunnel is a       rectangular field consisting of three rows and  n columns. At the beginning of the game the hero       is in some cell of the leftmost column. Some number of trains       rides towards the hero. Each train consists of two or more       neighbouring cells in some row of the field. All trains are moving from right to left at a speed of two cells       per second, and the hero runs from left to right at the speed of       one cell per second. For simplicity, the game is implemented so       that the hero and the trains move in turns. First, the hero moves       one cell to the right, then one square up or down, or stays idle.       Then all the trains move twice simultaneously one cell to the       left. Thus, in one move, Philip definitely makes a move to the       right and can move up or down. If at any point, Philip is in the       same cell with a train, he loses. If the train reaches the left       column, it continues to move as before, leaving the tunnel.

In a few       moments they were ready, and the dirigible of the rescue chipmunks       hit the road. We assume that the action takes place on a Cartesian plane. The       headquarters of the rescuers is located at point (x 1, y 1), and the distress       signal came from the point (x 2, y 2). Due to Gadget's engineering talent, the rescuers' dirigible can       instantly change its current velocity and direction of movement at       any moment and as many times as needed. The only limitation is:       the speed of the aircraft relative to the air can not exceed        meters per second. Of course, Gadget is a true rescuer and wants to reach the       destination as soon as possible. The matter is complicated by the       fact that the wind is blowing in the air and it affects the       movement of the dirigible. According to the weather forecast, the       wind will be defined by the vector (v  x, v  y) for the nearest  t seconds, and then will change to (w  x, w  y).

During the  i-th competition the participant must as quickly       as possible complete a ride along a straight line from point  s  i to point  f  i ( s  i < f  i). Measuring time is a complex process related to usage of a special       sensor and a time counter. Think of the front wheel of a bicycle       as a circle of radius  r.

628,"Max wants to buy a new skateboard. He has calculated the amount       of money that is needed to buy a new skateboard. He left a       calculator on the floor and went to ask some money from his       parents. Meanwhile his little brother Yusuf came and started to       press the keys randomly. Unfortunately Max has forgotten the       number which he had calculated. The only thing he knows is that       the number is divisible by 4. You are given a string  s consisting of digits (the number on the display       of the calculator after Yusuf randomly pressed the keys). Your       task is to find the number of substrings which are divisible by         4. A substring can start with a zero. A substring of a string is a nonempty sequence of consecutive characters. For example if string  s is 124       then we have four substrings that are divisible by 4: 12, 4, 24 and 124. For the string 04 the answer is three: 0, 4, 04. As input/output can reach huge size it is recommended to use fast       input/output methods: for example, prefer to use gets/scanf/printf instead of         getline/cin/cout in C++,       prefer to use BufferedReader/PrintWriter       instead of Scanner/System.out in Java.",The only line contains string  s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 3·105). The string  s contains only digits from 0 to 9.,"Print integer  a — the number of substrings of the string  s that are divisible by 4. Note that the answer can be huge, so you should use 64-bit integer type to store it. In C++ you can use the long long integer type and in         Java you can use long integer type.",

Find any solution or print -1 if it's impossible.","The first line of the input contains two integers  n and  k (4 ≤ n ≤ 1000,  n - 1 ≤ k ≤ 2n - 2) — the number of       cities and the maximum allowed number of roads, respectively. The second line contains four distinct integers  a,  b,  c and  d (1 ≤ a, b, c, d ≤ n).","Print -1 if it's       impossible to satisfy all the given conditions.

The second line should       contain  n distinct integers  u 1, u 2, ..., u  n where  u 1 = c and  u  n = d. Two paths generate at most 2n - 2 roads: (v 1, v 2), (v 2, v 3), ..., (v  n - 1, v  n), (u 1, u 2), (u 2, u 3), ..., (u  n - 1, u  n).

Otherwise there will be no any exclusivity. So Cicasso will       entirely hold the world tour in his native country — Berland. Cicasso is very devoted to his work and he wants to be distracted       as little as possible. Therefore he will visit only four cities.       These cities will be different, so no one could think that he has       ""favourites"". Of course, to save money, he will chose       the shortest paths between these cities. But as you have probably       guessed, Cicasso is a weird person. Although he doesn't like to       organize exhibitions, he likes to travel around the country and       enjoy its scenery. So he wants the total distance which he will       travel to be as large as possible. However, the sculptor is bad in       planning, so he asks you for help.

Four cities in the order of visiting marked as overlines: [1, 5, 2, 4]. Note that Berland is a high-tech country. So using       nanotechnologies all roads were altered so that they have the same       length. For the same reason moving using regular cars is not very       popular in the country, and it can happen that there are such       pairs of cities, one of which generally can not be reached by car       from the other one.

To do this, he wants to create a sculpture       depicting a well-known geometric primitive — convex polygon. Cicasso prepared for this a few blanks, which are rods with       integer lengths, and now he wants to bring them together. The          i-th rod is a segment of length  l  i. The sculptor plans to make a convex polygon with a nonzero area,       using all rods he has as       its sides. Each rod should be used as a side to its full length.

Just when Vanya will have entered the correct password, he       is immediately authorized on the site. Vanya will not enter any       password twice. Entering any passwords takes one second for Vanya. But if Vanya       will enter wrong password  k times, then he is able to make the next try only         5 seconds after that. Vanya makes       each try immediately, that is, at each moment when Vanya is able       to enter password, he is doing that.

If, at       the other hand, he enters it at the last try, he enters another         4 passwords before. He spends         2 seconds to enter first 2 passwords, then he waits 5 seconds as soon as he made 2 wrong tries.

In this problem, you need to find maximal and minimal elements of       an array. What could be simpler? You can imagine that the jury has an array, and initially you       know the only number  n — array's length. Array's elements are numbered from 1 to  n. You are allowed to compare two elements of the       array by using their indices  i and  j.

It's known that it's always possible to find both maximal and       minimal elements of the array by using no more than        comparisons, where ⌈ x⌉ is       the result of rounding  x up.

Firstly, your program has to read       the number  n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) — the length of the       array. It will be provided in the next line of the input. Further, your program can perform comparisons or report that the       answer is found.

753,"This problem is a little bit unusual. Here you are to implement       an interaction with a testing system. That means that you can make       queries and get responses in the online mode. Please be sure to       use the stream flushing operation after each query's output in       order not to leave part of your output in some buffer. For       example, in C++ you've got to use the fflush(stdout) function, in Java       — call System.out.flush(),       and in Pascal — flush(output). Bulls and Cows (also known as Cows and Bulls or Pigs and Bulls or       Bulls and Cleots) is an old code-breaking paper and pencil game       for two players, predating the similar commercially marketed board       game Mastermind. On a sheet of paper, the first player thinks a secret string.       This string consists only of digits and has the length 4. The digits in the string must be all different, no two or       more equal digits are allowed. Then the second player tries to guess his opponent's string. For       every guess the first player gives the number of matches. If the       matching digits are on their right positions, they are       ""bulls"", if on different positions, they are       ""cows"". Thus a response is a pair of numbers — the       number of ""bulls"" and the number of ""cows"". A       try can contain equal digits. More formally, let's the secret string is  s and the second player are trying to guess it       with a string  x. The number of ""bulls"" is a number of       such positions  i (1 ≤ i ≤ 4)       where  s[i] = x[i]. The number of       ""cows"" is a number of such digits  c that  s contains  c in the position  i (i.e.  s[i] = c),  x contains  c, but  x[i] ≠ c. For example, the secret string is ""0427"", the opponent's try is         ""0724"", then       the answer is 2 bulls and 2 cows (the bulls are ""0"" and       ""2"", the cows are ""4"" and ""7""). If       the secret string is ""0123"", the opponent's try is         ""0330"", then       the answer is 1 bull and 1 cow. In this problem you are to guess the string  s that the system has chosen. You only know that       the chosen string consists of 4       distinct digits. You can make queries to the testing system, each query is the       output of a single 4-digit string.       The answer to the query is the number of bulls and number of cows.       If the system's response equals ""4 0"", that means the       interaction with your problem is over and the program must       terminate. That is possible for two reasons — the program either       guessed the number  x or made an invalid action (for example, printed       letters instead of digits). You can hack solutions of other participants providing a 4-digit       string containing distinct digits — the secret string.","To read answers to the queries, the program must use the standard input. The program will receive pairs of non-negative integers in the       input, one pair per line. The first number in a pair is a number       of bulls and the second one is a number of cows of the string          s and the string  x  i printed by your program. If the system       response equals ""4 0"", then your solution should terminate. The testing system will let your program read the  i-th pair of integers from the input only after       your program displays the corresponding system query in the       output: prints value  x  i in a single line and executes operation         flush.","The program must use the standard output to print queries. Your program must output requests — 4-digit strings  x 1, x 2, ..., one per line.       After the output of each line the program must execute flush operation. The program       should read the answer to the query from the standard input. Your program is allowed to do at most 50 queries.","The secret string  s in the example is ""0123""."

773,"Vasya and Petya take part in a Codeforces round. The round lasts       for two hours and contains five problems. For this round the dynamic problem scoring is used. If you were       lucky not to participate in any Codeforces round with dynamic       problem scoring, here is what it means. The maximum point value of       the problem depends on the ratio of the number of participants who       solved the problem to the total number of round participants.       Everyone who made at least one submission is considered to be       participating in the round.   Pay attention to the range bounds. For example, if 40 people are       taking part in the round, and 10 of them solve a particular       problem, then the solvers fraction is equal to 1 / 4, and the problem's maximum point       value is equal to 1500. If the problem's maximum point value is equal to  x, then for each whole minute passed from the       beginning of the contest to the moment of the participant's       correct submission, the participant loses  x / 250 points. For example, if the problem's       maximum point value is 2000, and the participant submits a correct       solution to it 40 minutes into the round, this participant will be       awarded with 2000·(1 - 40 / 250) = 1680 points for this problem. There are  n participants in the round, including Vasya and       Petya. For each participant and each problem, the number of       minutes which passed between the beginning of the contest and the       submission of this participant to this problem is known. It's also       possible that this participant made no submissions to this problem. With two seconds until the end of the round, all participants'       submissions have passed pretests, and not a single hack attempt       has been made. Vasya believes that no more submissions or hack       attempts will be made in the remaining two seconds, and every       submission will pass the system testing. Unfortunately, Vasya is a cheater.

Remind that a geometric progression is a       sequence of integers  b 1, b 2, b 3, ..., where for each          i > 1 the respective term satisfies the       condition  b  i = b  i - 1·q, where  q is called the common ratio of the progression.       Progressions in Uzhlyandia are unusual: both  b 1 and  q can equal 0. Also, Dvastan gave Masha  m ""bad"" integers  a 1, a 2, ..., a  m, and an integer  l. Masha writes all progression terms one by one onto the board       (including repetitive) while condition |b  i| ≤ l is satisfied (|x| means absolute value of  x). There is an exception: if a term equals one of       the ""bad"" integers, Masha skips it (doesn't write onto       the board) and moves forward to the next term. But the lesson is going to end soon, so Masha has to calculate       how many integers will be written on the board. In order not to       get into depression, Masha asked you for help: help her calculate       how many numbers she will write, or print ""inf"" in case she needs to       write infinitely many integers.","The first line of input contains four integers  b 1,  q,  l,  m (-109 ≤ b 1, q ≤ 109, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105) — the initial term and the       common ratio of progression, absolute value of maximal number that       can be written on the board and the number of ""bad""       integers, respectively.

790,"A tree is an undirected connected graph without cycles. The       distance between two vertices is the number of edges in a simple       path between them. Limak is a little polar bear. He lives in a tree that consists of          n vertices, numbered 1 through  n. Limak recently learned how to jump. He can jump from a vertex to       any vertex within distance at most  k. For a pair of vertices (s, t) we define  f(s, t) as the minimum number of       jumps Limak needs to get from  s to  t.

Limak can jump to any vertex within distance at       most 2. For example, from the vertex         5 he can jump to any of vertices:         1, 2       and 4 (well, he can also jump to the       vertex 5 itself). There are        pairs of vertices (s, t) such that  s < t. For 5 of those pairs Limak would need two       jumps: (1, 6), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (5, 6).       For other 10 pairs one jump is       enough. So, the answer is 5·2 + 10·1 = 20. In the third sample, Limak can jump between every two vertices       directly.

If the problem's maximum point value is equal to  x, then for each whole minute passed from the       beginning of the contest to the moment of the participant's       correct submission, the participant loses  x / 250 points. For example, if the problem's       maximum point value is 2000, and the participant submits a correct       solution to it 40 minutes into the round, this participant will be       awarded with 2000·(1 - 40 / 250) = 1680 points for this problem. There are  n participants in the round, including Vasya and       Petya. For each participant and each problem, the number of       minutes which passed between the beginning of the contest and the       submission of this participant to this problem is known. It's also       possible that this participant made no submissions to this problem. With two seconds until the end of the round, all participants'       submissions have passed pretests, and not a single hack attempt       has been made. Vasya believes that no more submissions or hack       attempts will be made in the remaining two seconds, and every       submission will pass the system testing. Unfortunately, Vasya is a cheater. He has registered 109 + 7       new accounts for the round. Now Vasya can submit any of his       solutions from these new accounts in order to change the maximum       point values of the problems. Vasya can also submit any wrong       solutions to any problems. Note that Vasya can not submit correct       solutions to the problems he hasn't solved. Vasya seeks to score strictly more points than Petya in the       current round. Vasya has already prepared the scripts which allow       to obfuscate his solutions and submit them into the system from       any of the new accounts in just fractions of seconds. However,       Vasya doesn't want to make his cheating too obvious, so he wants       to achieve his goal while making submissions from the smallest       possible number of new accounts. Find the smallest number of new accounts Vasya needs in order to       beat Petya (provided that Vasya's assumptions are correct), or       report that Vasya can't achieve his goal.","The first line contains a single integer  n (2 ≤ n ≤ 120) — the number of round       participants, including Vasya and Petya. Each of the next  n lines contains five integers  a  i, 1, a  i, 2..., a  i, 5 ( - 1 ≤ a  i, j ≤ 119) — the number of minutes       passed between the beginning of the round and the submission of       problem  j by participant  i, or -1 if       participant  i hasn't solved problem  j. It is guaranteed that each participant has made at least one       successful submission. Vasya is listed as participant number 1, Petya is listed as       participant number 2, all the other participants are listed in no       particular order.","Output a single integer — the number of new accounts Vasya needs       to beat Petya, or -1 if       Vasya can't achieve his goal.","In the first example, Vasya's optimal strategy is to submit the       solutions to the last three problems from two new accounts. In       this case the first two problems will have the maximum point value       of 1000, while the last three problems will have the maximum point       value of 500. Vasya's score will be equal to 980 + 940 + 420 + 360 + 270 = 2970 points,       while Petya will score just 800 + 820 + 420 + 440 + 470 = 2950 points. In the second example, Vasya has to make a single unsuccessful       submission to any problem from two new accounts, and a single       successful submission to the first problem from the third new       account. In this case, the maximum point values of the problems       will be equal to 500, 1500, 1000, 1500, 3000. Vasya will score       2370 points, while Petya will score just 2294 points. In the third example, Vasya can achieve his goal by submitting       the solutions to the first four problems from 27 new accounts. The       maximum point values of the problems will be equal to 500, 500,       500, 500, 2000. Thanks to the high cost of the fifth problem,       Vasya will manage to beat Petya who solved the first four problems       very quickly, but couldn't solve the fifth one."

808,"It's been almost a week since Polycarp couldn't get rid of       insomnia. And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts          k days! When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked       him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average       amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records       of sleep times for the last  n days. So now he has a sequence  a 1, a 2, ..., a  n, where  a  i is the sleep time on the  i-th day. The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to       calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to       help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is       going to consider  k consecutive days as a week. So there will be          n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration.       For example, if  k = 2,  n = 3 and  a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .

809," This is an interactive problem. In         the output section below you will see the information about         flushing the output. On Sunday Leha the hacker took Nura from the house where she       lives and went with her to one of the most luxurious restaurants       in Vičkopolis. Upon arrival, they left the car in a huge parking       lot near the restaurant and hurried inside the building. In the restaurant a polite waiter immediately brought the menu to       Leha and Noora, consisting of  n dishes. It is interesting that all dishes in the       menu are numbered with integers from 1 to  n. After a little thought, the girl ordered       exactly  k different dishes from available in the menu. To       pass the waiting time while the chefs prepare ordered dishes, the       girl invited the hacker to play a game that will help them get to       know each other better. The game itself is very simple: Noora wants Leha to guess any two       dishes among all ordered. At the same time, she is ready to answer       only one type of questions. Leha can say two numbers  x and  y (1 ≤ x, y ≤ n). After       that Noora chooses some dish  a for the number  x such that, at first,  a is among the dishes Noora ordered ( x can be equal to  a), and, secondly, the value        is the minimum possible. By the same rules the girl chooses dish          b for  y. After that Noora says «TAK» to Leha, if ,       and «NIE» otherwise.       However, the restaurant is preparing quickly, so Leha has enough       time to ask no more than 60       questions. After that he should name numbers of any two dishes       Noora ordered. Help Leha to solve this problem! While helping Leha, you can ask queries to Noora no more than         60 times. Each query should be       printed in it's own line and have the form 1  x  y (1 ≤ x, y ≤ n). You       have to both print the end-of-line character and flush the output.       After flushing you should read the answer for this query from input. After each query jury's program will print one line «TAK» or «NIE» (without quotes) in input       stream depending on the girl's answer. To flush you can use (just after printing an integer and end-of-line):  Hacking For hacking you should write numbers  n and  k (2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 105) in the first line and, for       describing dishes Noora ordered,  k different integers  a 1, a 2, ..., a  k (1 ≤ a  i ≤ n), written in ascending order in       the second line.

This       summer Noora decided that she wants to earn some money, and took a       job in a shop as an assistant. Shop, where Noora is working, has a plan on the following  n days. For each day sales manager knows exactly,       that in  i-th day  k  i products will be put up for sale and       exactly  l  i clients will come to the shop that day.       Also, the manager is sure, that everyone, who comes to the shop,       buys exactly one product or, if there aren't any left, leaves the       shop without buying anything. Moreover, due to the short       shelf-life of the products, manager established the following       rule: if some part of the products left on the shelves at the end       of the day, that products aren't kept on the next day and are sent       to the dump. For advertising purposes manager offered to start a sell-out in       the shop. He asked Noora to choose any  f days from  n next for sell-outs. On each of  f chosen days the number of products were put up       for sale would be doubled. Thus, if on  i-th day shop planned to put up for sale  k  i products and Noora has chosen this day       for sell-out, shelves of the shop would keep 2·k  i products. Consequently, there is an       opportunity to sell two times more products on days of sell-out. Noora's task is to choose  f days to maximize total number of sold products.       She asks you to help her with such a difficult problem.","The first line contains two integers  n and  f (1 ≤ n ≤ 105, 0 ≤ f ≤ n)       denoting the number of days in shop's plan and the number of days       that Noora has to choose for sell-out.

815,"Karen has just arrived at school, and she has a math test today! The test is about basic addition and subtraction. Unfortunately,       the teachers were too busy writing tasks for Codeforces rounds,       and had no time to make an actual test. So, they just put one       question in the test that is worth all the points. There are  n integers written on a row. Karen must       alternately add and subtract each pair of adjacent integers, and       write down the sums or differences on the next row. She must       repeat this process on the values on the next row, and so on,       until only one integer remains. The first operation should be addition. Note that, if she ended the previous row by adding the integers,       she should start the next row by subtracting, and vice versa. The teachers will simply look at the last integer, and then if it       is correct, Karen gets a perfect score, otherwise, she gets a zero       for the test. Karen has studied well for this test, but she is scared that she       might make a mistake somewhere and it will cause her final answer       to be wrong. If the process is followed, what number can she       expect to be written on the last row? Since this number can be quite large, output only the       non-negative remainder after dividing it by 109 + 7.","The first line of input contains a single integer  n (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000), the number of       numbers written on the first row.

So       it's a necessity to not let any uninvited guests in. There are 26 entrances in Jelly Castle, enumerated with uppercase       English letters from A to         Z. Because of security       measures, each guest is known to be assigned an entrance he should       enter the castle through. The door of each entrance is opened       right before the first guest's arrival and closed right after the       arrival of the last guest that should enter the castle through       this entrance.

More formally, there is a singly liked list built on an array of          n elements. Element with index  i contains two integers:  value  i is the integer value in this element,       and  next  i that is the index of the next element of       the singly linked list (or -1, if the current element is the       last). The list is sorted, i.e. if  next  i ≠  - 1, then  value  next  i > value  i. You are given the number of elements in the list  n, the index of the first element  start, and the integer  x. You can make up to 2000 queries of       the following two types: Write a program that solves this problem. To make a query of the first type, print ? i (1 ≤ i ≤ n), where i is the index of element you       want to know information about.

867,"Attention: we lost all the test cases for this problem, so       instead of solving the problem, we need you to generate test       cases. We're going to give you the answer, and you need to print a       test case that produces the given answer. The original problem is       in the following paragraph. People don't use cash as often as they used to. Having a credit       card solves some of the hassles of cash, such as having to receive       change when you can't form the exact amount of money needed to       purchase an item. Typically cashiers will give you as few coins as       possible in change, but they don't have to. For example, if your       change is 30 cents, a cashier could give you a 5 cent piece and a       25 cent piece, or they could give you three 10 cent pieces, or ten       1 cent pieces, two 5 cent pieces, and one 10 cent piece.       Altogether there are 18 different ways to make 30 cents using only       1 cent pieces, 5 cent pieces, 10 cent pieces, and 25 cent pieces.       Two ways are considered different if they contain a different       number of at least one type of coin.

868,"Have you ever tried to explain to the coordinator, why it is       eight hours to the contest and not a single problem has been       prepared yet? Misha had. And this time he has a really strong excuse: he faced a       space-time paradox! Space and time replaced each other. The entire universe turned into an enormous clock face with three       hands — hour, minute, and second. Time froze, and clocks now show       the time  h hours,  m minutes,  s seconds. Last time Misha talked with the coordinator at  t 1 o'clock, so now he       stands on the number  t 1 on the clock face. The       contest should be ready by  t 2 o'clock. In the terms of       paradox it means that Misha has to go to number  t 2 somehow. Note that he       doesn't have to move forward only: in these circumstances time has       no direction. Clock hands are very long, and Misha cannot get round them. He       also cannot step over as it leads to the collapse of space-time.       That is, if hour clock points 12 and Misha stands at 11 then he       cannot move to 1 along the top arc. He has to follow all the way       round the clock center (of course, if there are no other hands on       his way). Given the hands' positions,  t 1, and  t 2, find if Misha can       prepare the contest on time (or should we say on space?). That is, find if he       can move from  t 1 to  t 2 by the clock face.","Five integers  h,  m,  s,  t 1,  t 2 (1 ≤ h ≤ 12, 0 ≤ m, s ≤ 59, 1 ≤ t 1, t 2 ≤ 12,  t 1 ≠ t 2).

Ithea and Chtholly want to play a game in order to determine who       can use the kitchen tonight.   Initially, Ithea puts  n clear sheets of paper in a line. They are       numbered from 1 to  n from left to right. This game will go on for  m rounds. In each round, Ithea will give Chtholly       an integer between 1 and  c, and Chtholly needs to choose one of the sheets       to write down this number (if there is already a number before,       she will erase the original one and replace it with the new one). Chtholly wins if, at any time, all the sheets are filled with a       number and the  n numbers are in non-decreasing order looking from       left to right from sheet 1 to sheet          n, and if after  m rounds she still doesn't win, she loses the game. Chtholly really wants to win the game as she wants to cook       something for Willem. But she doesn't know how to win the game. So       Chtholly finds you, and your task is to write a program to receive       numbers that Ithea gives Chtholly and help her make the decision       on which sheet of paper write this number. In each round, your program needs to read one line containing a       single integer  p  i (1 ≤ p  i ≤ c), indicating the number given       to Chtholly. Your program should then output a line containing an integer       between 1 and  n, indicating the number of sheet to write down       this number in.  After outputting each line, don't         forget to flush the output. For example:   If Chtholly wins at the end of a         round, no more input will become available and your program         should terminate normally.

She then received a 2 and decided to write it in the 1st sheet. Then she received a 1 and wrote it in the 2nd sheet. At last, she received a 3 and replaced 1 with 3 in       the 2nd sheet. At this time all the       sheets were filled with a number and they were non-decreasing, so       she won the game.   Note that it is required that your         program terminate immediately after Chtholly wins and do not         read numbers from the input for the remaining rounds. If not,         undefined behaviour may arise and it won't be sure whether your         program will be accepted or rejected.

For following moves,       there are some restrictions: if during last move the opposite       player put his chip to cell with coordinates (x  l, y  l) in some small field, the next move       should be done in one of the cells of the small field with       coordinates (x  l, y  l). For example, if in the first move a       player puts his chip to lower left cell of central field, then the       second player on his next move should put his chip into some cell       of lower left field (pay attention to the first test case).

The three friends are very smart so they passed all the       challenges very quickly and finally reached the destination. But       the treasure can only belong to one cat so they started to think       of something which can determine who is worthy of the treasure.       Instantly, Kuro came up with some ribbons. A random colorful ribbon is given to each of the cats. Each color       of the ribbon can be represented as an uppercase or lowercase       Latin letter. Let's call a consecutive subsequence of colors that       appears in the ribbon a subribbon. The beauty of a ribbon is defined as       the maximum number of times one of its subribbon appears in the       ribbon. The more the subribbon appears, the more beautiful is the       ribbon.

991,"Translator's note: in Russia's most widespread grading system,       there are four grades: 5, 4, 3, 2, the higher the better, roughly       corresponding to A, B, C and F respectively in American grading system. The term is coming to an end and students start thinking about       their grades. Today, a professor told his students that the grades       for his course would be given out automatically  — he would       calculate the simple average (arithmetic mean) of all grades given       out for lab works this term and round to the nearest integer. The       rounding would be done in favour of the student — 4.54.5 would       be rounded up to 55 (as in example 3), but 4.44.4 would be       rounded down to 44. This does not bode well for Vasya who didn't think those lab       works would influence anything, so he may receive a grade worse       than 55 (maybe even the dreaded 22). However, the       professor allowed him to redo some of his works of Vasya's       choosing to increase his average grade.
