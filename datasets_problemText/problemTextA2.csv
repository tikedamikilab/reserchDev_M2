2,"The winner of the card game popular in Berland ""Berlogging"" is determined according to the following rules. If at the end of the game there is only one player with the maximum number of points, he is the winner. The situation becomes more difficult if the number of such players is more than one. During each round a player gains or loses a particular number of points. In the course of the game the number of points is registered in the line ""name score"", where name is a player's name, and score is the number of points gained in this round, which is an integer number. If score is negative, this means that the player has lost in the round. So, if two or more players have the maximum number of points (say, it equals to m) at the end of the game, than wins the one of them who scored at least m points first. Initially each player has 0 points. It's guaranteed that at the end of the game at least one player has a positive number of points.","The first line contains an integer number n (1  ≤  n  ≤  1000), n is the number of rounds played.

7,"A famous Berland's painter Kalevitch likes to shock the public. One of his last obsessions is chess. For more than a thousand years people have been playing this old game on uninteresting, monotonous boards. Kalevitch decided to put an end to this tradition and to introduce a new attitude to chessboards. As before, the chessboard is a square-checkered board with the squares arranged in a 8 × 8 grid, each square is painted black or white. Kalevitch suggests that chessboards should be painted in the following manner: there should be chosen a horizontal or a vertical line of 8 squares (i.e. a row or a column), and painted black. Initially the whole chessboard is white, and it can be painted in the above described way one or more times. It is allowed to paint a square many times, but after the first time it does not change its colour any more and remains black. Kalevitch paints chessboards neatly, and it is impossible to judge by an individual square if it was painted with a vertical or a horizontal stroke. Kalevitch hopes that such chessboards will gain popularity, and he will be commissioned to paint chessboards, which will help him ensure a comfortable old age. The clients will inform him what chessboard they want to have, and the painter will paint a white chessboard meeting the client's requirements. It goes without saying that in such business one should economize on everything — for each commission he wants to know the minimum amount of strokes that he has to paint to fulfill the client's needs. You are asked to help Kalevitch with this task.","The input file contains 8 lines, each of the lines contains 8 characters. The given matrix describes the client's requirements, W character stands for a white square, and B character — for a square painted black. It is guaranteed that client's requirments can be fulfilled with a sequence of allowed strokes (vertical/column or horizontal/row).",Output the only number — the minimum amount of rows and columns that Kalevitch has to paint on the white chessboard to meet the client's requirements.

33,"In one little known, but very beautiful country called Waterland, lives a lovely shark Valerie. Like all the sharks, she has several rows of teeth, and feeds on crucians. One of Valerie's distinguishing features is that while eating one crucian she uses only one row of her teeth, the rest of the teeth are ""relaxing"". For a long time our heroine had been searching the sea for crucians, but a great misfortune happened. Her teeth started to ache, and she had to see the local dentist, lobster Ashot. As a professional, Ashot quickly relieved Valerie from her toothache. Moreover, he managed to determine the cause of Valerie's developing caries (for what he was later nicknamed Cap). It turned that Valerie eats too many crucians. To help Valerie avoid further reoccurrence of toothache, Ashot found for each Valerie's tooth its residual viability. Residual viability of a tooth is a value equal to the amount of crucians that Valerie can eat with this tooth. Every time Valerie eats a crucian, viability of all the teeth used for it will decrease by one. When the viability of at least one tooth becomes negative, the shark will have to see the dentist again.  Unhappy, Valerie came back home, where a portion of crucians was waiting for her. For sure, the shark couldn't say no to her favourite meal, but she had no desire to go back to the dentist. That's why she decided to eat the maximum amount of crucians from the portion but so that the viability of no tooth becomes negative.  As Valerie is not good at mathematics, she asked you to help her to find out the total amount of crucians that she can consume for dinner. We should remind you that while eating one crucian Valerie uses exactly one row of teeth and the viability of each tooth from this row decreases by one.","The first line contains three integers n, m, k (1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 1000, 0 ≤ k ≤ 106) — total amount of Valerie's teeth, amount of tooth rows and amount of crucians in Valerie's portion for dinner. Then follow n lines, each containing two integers: r (1 ≤ r ≤ m) — index of the row, where belongs the corresponding tooth, and c (0 ≤ c ≤ 106) — its residual viability. It's guaranteed that each tooth row has positive amount of teeth.",In the first line output the maximum amount of crucians that Valerie can consume for dinner.

39,"C*++ language is quite similar to C++. The similarity manifests itself in the fact that the programs written in C*++ sometimes behave unpredictably and lead to absolutely unexpected effects. For example, let's imagine an arithmetic expression in C*++ that looks like this (expression is the main term): For example, ""5*a++-3*++a+a++"" is a valid expression in C*++. Thus, we have a sum consisting of several summands divided by signs ""+"" or ""-"". Every summand is an expression ""a++"" or ""++a"" multiplied by some integer coefficient. If the coefficient is omitted, it is suggested being equal to 1. The calculation of such sum in C*++ goes the following way. First all the summands are calculated one after another, then they are summed by the usual arithmetic rules. If the summand contains ""a++"", then during the calculation first the value of the ""a"" variable is multiplied by the coefficient, then value of ""a"" is increased by 1. If the summand contains ""++a"", then the actions on it are performed in the reverse order: first ""a"" is increased by 1, then — multiplied by the coefficient. The summands may be calculated in any order, that's why sometimes the result of the calculation is completely unpredictable! Your task is to find its largest possible value.","The first input line contains an integer a ( - 1000 ≤ a ≤ 1000) — the initial value of the variable ""a"".

It should be mentioned that when a ball is thrown it may pass the beginning of the circle. For example, if n = 5, then after the third throw the child number 2 has the ball again. Overall, n - 1 throws are made, and the game ends. The problem is that not all the children get the ball during the game.

Uncle Fyodor had an idea how to solve the problem justly: they should suppose that the console was sent to all three of them and play it in turns. Everybody got relieved but then yet another burning problem popped up — who will play first? This time Matroskin came up with a brilliant solution, suggesting the most fair way to find it out: play rock-paper-scissors together. The rules of the game are very simple. On the count of three every player shows a combination with his hand (or paw). The combination corresponds to one of three things: a rock, scissors or paper. Some of the gestures win over some other ones according to well-known rules: the rock breaks the scissors, the scissors cut the paper, and the paper gets wrapped over the stone. Usually there are two players. Yet there are three friends, that’s why they decided to choose the winner like that: If someone shows the gesture that wins over the other two players, then that player wins.

The roommate left hints like ""Hidden to the left of the i-th box"" (""To the left of i""), ""Hidden to the right of the i-th box"" (""To the right of i""). Such hints mean that there are no flakes in the i-th box as well. The Cereal Guy wants to know the minimal number of boxes he necessarily needs to check to find the flakes considering all the hints.

He could manage to sum 1018 numbers in a single second. One day in 230 AD Shapur was trying to find out if any one can possibly do calculations faster than him. As a result he made a very great contest and asked every one to come and take part. In his contest he gave the contestants many different pairs of numbers. Each number is made from digits 0 or 1. The contestants should write a new number corresponding to the given pair of numbers. The rule is simple: The i-th digit of the answer is 1 if and only if the i-th digit of the two given numbers differ. In the other case the i-th digit of the answer is 0. Shapur made many numbers and first tried his own speed. He saw that he can perform these operations on numbers of length ∞ (length of a number is number of digits in it) in a glance! He always gives correct answers so he expects the contestants to give correct answers, too.

When Harry told his friends about these spells, Ron Weasley was amazed. After all, if they succeed in turning sand into lead, lead into gold, and then turning part of the gold into sand again and so on, then it will be possible to start with a small amount of sand and get huge amounts of gold! Even an infinite amount of gold! Hermione Granger, by contrast, was skeptical about that idea. She argues that according to the law of conservation of matter getting an infinite amount of matter, even using magic, is impossible. On the contrary, the amount of matter may even decrease during transformation, being converted to magical energy. Though Hermione's theory seems convincing, Ron won't believe her. As far as Ron is concerned, Hermione made up her law of conservation of matter to stop Harry and Ron wasting their time with this nonsense, and to make them go and do homework instead. That's why Ron has already collected a certain amount of sand for the experiments. A quarrel between the friends seems unavoidable...

That's why a question arises: ""Which integer type to use if one wants to store a positive integer n?"" Petya knows only 5 integer types: 1) byte occupies 1 byte and allows you to store numbers from  - 128 to 127 2) short occupies 2 bytes and allows you to store numbers from  - 32768 to 32767 3) int occupies 4 bytes and allows you to store numbers from  - 2147483648 to 2147483647 4) long occupies 8 bytes and allows you to store numbers from  - 9223372036854775808 to 9223372036854775807 5) BigInteger can store any integer number, but at that it is not a primitive type, and operations with it are much slower.

Your program should remove from a string all pairs of identical letters, which are consecutive. If after the removal there appear new pairs, the program should remove them as well. Technically, its work should be equivalent to the following: while the string contains a pair of consecutive identical letters, the pair should be deleted. Note that deleting of the consecutive identical letters can be done in any order, as any order leads to the same result. ",The input data consists of a single line to be processed. The length of the line is from 1 to 2·105 characters inclusive. The string contains only lowercase Latin letters. ,Print the given string after it is processed.

83,"Valery is very interested in magic. Magic attracts him so much that he sees it everywhere. He explains any strange and weird phenomenon through intervention of supernatural forces. But who would have thought that even in a regular array of numbers Valera manages to see something beautiful and magical. Valera absolutely accidentally got a piece of ancient parchment on which an array of numbers was written. He immediately thought that the numbers in this array were not random. As a result of extensive research Valera worked out a wonderful property that a magical array should have: an array is defined as magic if its minimum and maximum coincide. He decided to share this outstanding discovery with you, but he asks you for help in return. Despite the tremendous intelligence and wit, Valera counts very badly and so you will have to complete his work.

We will talk about some other problem below, there you also are going to deal with tiling a rectangular field with dominoes. You are given a 4 × n rectangular field, that is the field that contains four lines and n columns. You have to find for it any tiling by 1 × 2 dominoes such that each of the n - 1 potential vertical cuts along the grid lines intersects at least one domino, splitting it in two. No two dominoes in the sought tiling should overlap, each square of the field should be covered by exactly one domino.

He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitones Vasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor. Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones. A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones. For example, the triad ""C E G"" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet ""C# B F"" is minor, because if we order the notes as ""B C# F"", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.

104,"One rainy gloomy evening when all modules hid in the nearby cafes to drink hot energetic cocktails, the Hexadecimal virus decided to fly over the Mainframe to look for a Great Idea. And she has found one! Why not make her own Codeforces, with blackjack and other really cool stuff? Many people will surely be willing to visit this splendid shrine of high culture. In Mainframe a standard pack of 52 cards is used to play blackjack. The pack contains cards of 13 values: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, jacks, queens, kings and aces. Each value also exists in one of four suits: hearts, diamonds, clubs and spades. Also, each card earns some value in points assigned to it: cards with value from two to ten earn from 2 to 10 points, correspondingly. An ace can either earn 1 or 11, whatever the player wishes. The picture cards (king, queen and jack) earn 10 points. The number of points a card earns does not depend on the suit. The rules of the game are very simple. The player gets two cards, if the sum of points of those cards equals n, then the player wins, otherwise the player loses. The player has already got the first card, it's the queen of spades. To evaluate chances for victory, you should determine how many ways there are to get the second card so that the sum of points exactly equals n.",The only line contains n (1 ≤ n ≤ 25) — the required sum of points.,Print the numbers of ways to get the second card in the required way if the first card is the queen of spades.
105,"In Disgaea as in most role-playing games, characters have skills that determine the character's ability to use certain weapons or spells. If the character does not have the necessary skill, he cannot use it. The skill level is represented as an integer that increases when you use this skill. Different character classes are characterized by different skills.  Unfortunately, the skills that are uncommon for the given character's class are quite difficult to obtain. To avoid this limitation, there is the so-called transmigration.  Transmigration is reincarnation of the character in a new creature. His soul shifts to a new body and retains part of his experience from the previous life.  As a result of transmigration the new character gets all the skills of the old character and the skill levels are reduced according to the k coefficient (if the skill level was equal to x, then after transmigration it becomes equal to [kx], where [y] is the integral part of y). If some skill's levels are strictly less than 100, these skills are forgotten (the character does not have them any more). After that the new character also gains the skills that are specific for his class, but are new to him. The levels of those additional skills are set to 0.  Thus, one can create a character with skills specific for completely different character classes via transmigrations. For example, creating a mage archer or a thief warrior is possible.  You are suggested to solve the following problem: what skills will the character have after transmigration and what will the levels of those skills be?","The first line contains three numbers n, m and k — the number of skills the current character has, the number of skills specific for the class into which the character is going to transmigrate and the reducing coefficient respectively; n and m are integers, and k is a real number with exactly two digits after decimal point (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 20, 0.01 ≤ k ≤ 0.99). Then follow n lines, each of which describes a character's skill in the form ""name exp"" — the skill's name and the character's skill level: name is a string and exp is an integer in range from 0 to 9999, inclusive.  Then follow m lines each of which contains names of skills specific for the class, into which the character transmigrates.  All names consist of lowercase Latin letters and their lengths can range from 1 to 20 characters, inclusive. All character's skills have distinct names. Besides the skills specific for the class into which the player transmigrates also have distinct names.","Print on the first line number z — the number of skills the character will have after the transmigration. Then print z lines, on each of which print a skill's name and level, separated by a single space. The skills should be given in the lexicographical order."

The problem does not state all the game's rules explicitly — you can find them later yourselves if you want. To play durak you need a pack of 36 cards. Each card has a suit (""S"", ""H"", ""D"" and ""C"") and a rank (in the increasing order ""6"", ""7"", ""8"", ""9"", ""T"", ""J"", ""Q"", ""K"" and ""A""). At the beginning of the game one suit is arbitrarily chosen as trump.  The players move like that: one player puts one or several of his cards on the table and the other one should beat each of them with his cards. A card beats another one if both cards have similar suits and the first card has a higher rank then the second one. Besides, a trump card can beat any non-trump card whatever the cards’ ranks are.

It converts an array of unsigned 8-bit integers into a sequence of characters to print, using the following method. The integers of the array are processed one by one, starting from the first. Processing i-th element of the array is done in three steps: 1. The 8-bit binary notation of the ASCII-code of the previous printed character is reversed. When the first element of the array is processed, the result of this step is considered to be 0. 2. The i-th element of the array is subtracted from the result of the previous step modulo 256. 3.

Let's consider that all lines in the poems consist of lowercase Latin letters (without spaces). Letters ""a"", ""e"", ""i"", ""o"", ""u"" are considered vowels. Two lines rhyme if their suffixes that start from the k-th vowels (counting from the end) match. If a line has less than k vowels, then such line can't rhyme with any other line. For example, if k = 1, lines commit and hermit rhyme (the corresponding suffixes equal it), and if k = 2, they do not rhyme (ommit ≠ ermit). Today on a literature lesson Vera learned that quatrains can contain four different schemes of rhymes, namely the following ones (the same letters stand for rhyming lines):  If all lines of a quatrain pairwise rhyme, then the quatrain can belong to any rhyme scheme (this situation is represented by aaaa). If all quatrains of a poem belong to the same rhyme scheme, then we can assume that the whole poem belongs to this rhyme scheme. If in each quatrain all lines pairwise rhyme, then the rhyme scheme of the poem is aaaa. Let us note that it doesn't matter whether lines from different quatrains rhyme with each other or not.

Sam would spend the whole summer stocking hay to feed Dawn in winter. Sam scythed hay and put it into haystack. As Sam was a bright farmer, he tried to make the process of storing hay simpler and more convenient to use. He collected the hay into cubical hay blocks of the same size. Then he stored the blocks in his barn. After a summer spent in hard toil Sam stored A·B·C hay blocks and stored them in a barn as a rectangular parallelepiped A layers high.

However, the game is now over and each square of the board contains exactly one number. To understand who has won, they need to count the number of winning squares. To determine if the particular square is winning you should do the following. Calculate the sum of all numbers on the squares that share this column (including the given square) and separately calculate the sum of all numbers on the squares that share this row (including the given square). A square is considered winning if the sum of the column numbers is strictly greater than the sum of the row numbers. For instance, lets game was ended like is shown in the picture. Then the purple cell is winning, because the sum of its column numbers equals 8 + 3 + 6 + 7 = 24, sum of its row numbers equals 9 + 5 + 3 + 2 = 19, and 24 > 19.",The first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 30).

She has been so hasty that she has nearly forgotten to leave the two of her darling children some money to buy lunches in the school cafeteria. She fished in the purse and found some number of coins, or to be exact, n coins of arbitrary values a1, a2, ..., an. But as Mom was running out of time, she didn't split the coins for you two. So she scribbled a note asking you to split the money equally. As you woke up, you found Mom's coins and read her note. ""But why split the money equally?"" — you thought. After all, your twin is sleeping and he won't know anything. So you decided to act like that: pick for yourself some subset of coins so that the sum of values of your coins is strictly larger than the sum of values of the remaining coins that your twin will have. However, you correctly thought that if you take too many coins, the twin will suspect the deception. So, you've decided to stick to the following strategy to avoid suspicions: you take the minimum number of coins, whose sum of values is strictly more than the sum of values of the remaining coins.

163,"One day Polycarpus got hold of two non-empty strings s and t, consisting of lowercase Latin letters. Polycarpus is quite good with strings, so he immediately wondered, how many different pairs of ""x y"" are there, such that x is a substring of string s, y is a subsequence of string t, and the content of x and y is the same. Two pairs are considered different, if they contain different substrings of string s or different subsequences of string t. Read the whole statement to understand the definition of different substrings and subsequences. The length of string s is the number of characters in it. If we denote the length of the string s as |s|, we can write the string as s = s1s2... s|s|. A substring of s is a non-empty string x = s[a... b] = sasa + 1... sb (1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ |s|). For example, ""code"" and ""force"" are substrings or ""codeforces"", while ""coders"" is not. Two substrings s[a... b] and s[c... d] are considered to be different if a ≠ c or b ≠ d. For example, if s=""codeforces"", s[2...2] and s[6...6] are different, though their content is the same.

We know for the i-th trolleybus that it leaves at the moment of time ti seconds, can go at a speed of no greater than vi meters per second, and accelerate with an acceleration no greater than a meters per second squared. A trolleybus can decelerate as quickly as you want (magic!). It can change its acceleration as fast as you want, as well. Note that the maximum acceleration is the same for all trolleys. Despite the magic the trolleys are still powered by an electric circuit and cannot overtake each other (the wires are to blame, of course). If a trolleybus catches up with another one, they go together one right after the other until they arrive at the final station. Also, the drivers are driving so as to arrive at the final station as quickly as possible. You, as head of the trolleybuses' fans' club, are to determine for each trolley the minimum time by which it can reach the final station. At the time of arrival at the destination station the trolleybus does not necessarily have zero speed. When a trolley is leaving the depot, its speed is considered equal to zero.

The disk has m recorded files, the i-th file occupies clusters with numbers ai, 1, ai, 2, ..., ai, ni. These clusters are not necessarily located consecutively on the disk, but the order in which they are given corresponds to their sequence in the file (cluster ai, 1 contains the first fragment of the i-th file, cluster ai, 2 has the second fragment, etc.). Also the disc must have one or several clusters which are free from files. You are permitted to perform operations of copying the contents of cluster number i to cluster number j (i and j must be different). Moreover, if the cluster number j used to keep some information, it is lost forever. Clusters are not cleaned, but after the defragmentation is complete, some of them are simply declared unusable (although they may possibly still contain some fragments of files). Your task is to use a sequence of copy operations to ensure that each file occupies a contiguous area of memory. Each file should occupy a consecutive cluster section, the files must follow one after another from the beginning of the hard disk. After defragmentation all free (unused) clusters should be at the end of the hard disk. After defragmenting files can be placed in an arbitrary order.

The laser charges for a seconds, and then shoots continuously for b seconds. Then, it charges for a seconds again. Then it shoots continuously for b seconds again and so on. Vasya knows numbers a and b. He also knows that while the laser is shooting, Vasya must be in the trench, but while the laser is charging, Vasya can safely move around the field.

191,"The ancient Berlanders believed that the longer the name, the more important its bearer is. Thus, Berland kings were famous for their long names. But long names are somewhat inconvenient, so the Berlanders started to abbreviate the names of their kings. They called every king by the first letters of its name. Thus, the king, whose name was Victorious Vasily Pupkin, was always called by the berlanders VVP. In Berland over its long history many dynasties of kings replaced each other, but they were all united by common traditions. Thus, according to one Berland traditions, to maintain stability in the country, the first name of the heir should be the same as the last name his predecessor (hence, the first letter of the abbreviated name of the heir coincides with the last letter of the abbreviated name of the predecessor). Berlanders appreciate stability, so this tradition has never been broken. Also Berlanders like perfection, so another tradition requires that the first name of the first king in the dynasty coincides with the last name of the last king in this dynasty (hence, the first letter of the abbreviated name of the first king coincides with the last letter of the abbreviated name of the last king). This tradition, of course, has also been always observed. The name of a dynasty is formed by very simple rules: we take all the short names of the kings in the order in which they ruled, and write them in one line.

Robo-Wallace has several advantages over the other guys. For example, he can hit the ball directly to the specified point. And yet, the notion of a giveaway is foreign to him. The combination of these features makes the Robo-Wallace the perfect footballer — as soon as the ball gets to him, he can just aim and hit the goal. He followed this tactics in the first half of the match, but he hit the goal rarely. The opposing team has a very good goalkeeper who catches most of the balls that fly directly into the goal. But Robo-Wallace is a quick thinker, he realized that he can cheat the goalkeeper. After all, they are playing in a football box with solid walls. Robo-Wallace can kick the ball to the other side, then the goalkeeper will not try to catch the ball. Then, if the ball bounces off the wall and flies into the goal, the goal will at last be scored. Your task is to help Robo-Wallace to detect a spot on the wall of the football box, to which the robot should kick the ball, so that the ball bounces once and only once off this wall and goes straight to the goal. In the first half of the match Robo-Wallace got a ball in the head and was severely hit. As a result, some of the schemes have been damaged.

In the given coordinate system you are given:  A goal is scored when the center of the ball crosses the OY axis in the given coordinate system between (0, y1) and (0, y2). The ball moves along a straight line. The ball's hit on the wall is perfectly elastic (the ball does not shrink from the hit), the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection. If the ball bounces off the wall not to the goal, that is, if it hits the other wall or the goal post, then the opposing team catches the ball and Robo-Wallace starts looking for miscalculation and gets dysfunctional.

Manao has determined that if the stretch of DNA contains a maximal sequence of consecutive identical nucleotides that is of even length, then the protein will be nonfunctional. For example, consider a protein described by DNA string ""GTTAAAG"". It contains four maximal sequences of consecutive identical nucleotides: ""G"", ""TT"", ""AAA"", and ""G"". The protein is nonfunctional because sequence ""TT"" has even length. Manao is trying to obtain a functional protein from the protein he currently has.

He has recently read an encyclopedia article that described the method of median smoothing (or median filter) and its many applications in science and engineering. Vasya liked the idea of the method very much, and he decided to try it in practice. Applying the simplest variant of median smoothing to the sequence of numbers a1, a2, ..., an will result a new sequence b1, b2, ..., bn obtained by the following algorithm: The median of a set of three numbers is the number that goes on the second place, when these three numbers are written in the non-decreasing order. For example, the median of the set 5, 1, 2 is number 2, and the median of set 1, 0, 1 is equal to 1. In order to make the task easier, Vasya decided to apply the method to sequences consisting of zeros and ones only. Having made the procedure once, Vasya looked at the resulting sequence and thought: what if I apply the algorithm to it once again, and then apply it to the next result, and so on? Vasya tried a couple of examples and found out that after some number of median smoothing algorithm applications the sequence can stop changing. We say that the sequence is stable, if it does not change when the median smoothing is applied to it. Now Vasya wonders, whether the sequence always eventually becomes stable. He asks you to write a program that, given a sequence of zeros and ones, will determine whether it ever becomes stable.

The number of black pawns placed is not necessarily equal to the number of white pawns placed.  Lets enumerate rows and columns with integers from 1 to 8. Rows are numbered from top to bottom, while columns are numbered from left to right. Now we denote as (r, c) the cell located at the row r and at the column c. There are always two players A and B playing the game. Player A plays with white pawns, while player B plays with black ones. The goal of player A is to put any of his pawns to the row 1, while player B tries to put any of his pawns to the row 8. As soon as any of the players completes his goal the game finishes immediately and the succeeded player is declared a winner. Player A moves first and then they alternate turns.

Any move is possible only if the targeted cell is empty. It's guaranteed that for any scenario of the game there will always be at least one move available for any of the players. Moving upward means that the pawn located in (r, c) will go to the cell (r - 1, c), while moving down means the pawn located in (r, c) will go to the cell (r + 1, c).

Each character of Kevin's string represents Kevin's score on one of the n questions of the olympiad—'1' for a correctly identified cow and '0' otherwise. However, all is not lost. Kevin is a big proponent of alternative thinking and believes that his score, instead of being the sum of his points, should be the length of the longest alternating subsequence of his string. Here, we define an alternating subsequence of a string as a not-necessarily contiguous subsequence where no two consecutive elements are equal. For example, {0, 1, 0, 1}, {1, 0, 1}, and {1, 0, 1, 0} are alternating sequences, while {1, 0, 0} and {0, 1, 0, 1, 1} are not. Kevin, being the sneaky little puffball that he is, is willing to hack into the USAICO databases to improve his score. In order to be subtle, he decides that he will flip exactly one substring—that is, take a contiguous non-empty substring of his score and change all '0's in that substring to '1's and vice versa. After such an operation, Kevin wants to know the length of the longest possible alternating subsequence that his string could have.",The first line contains the number of questions on the olympiad n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000).

The education is not easy because you need to have fundamental knowledge in different areas, which sometimes are not related to each other.  For example, you should know linguistics very well. You learn a structure of Reberland language as foreign language. In this language words are constructed according to the following rules. First you need to choose the ""root"" of the word — some string which has more than 4 letters. Then several strings with the length 2 or 3 symbols are appended to this word. The only restriction —  it is not allowed to append the same string twice in a row.

Here is one exercise that you have found in your task list. You are given the word s. Find all distinct strings with the length 2 or 3, which can be suffixes of this word according to the word constructing rules in Reberland language.  Two strings are considered distinct if they have different length or there is a position in which corresponding characters do not match.  Let's look at the example: the word abacabaca is given.

Anyway, they like to tour a lot and have surprising amounts of energy to do extremely long tours. However, they hate spending two consecutive days without having a concert, so they would like to avoid it. A tour is defined by a sequence of concerts and days-off.

Consider that there are 6 educational days in week and maximum number of classes per educational day is 7 (classes numerated from 1 to 7 for each educational day). It is known that in university n students study, m professors work and there are a classrooms for conducting classes. Also you have two-dimensional array with n × m size which contains the following information. The number which stays in i-th row and j-th column equals to the number of classes which professor j must conduct with the group i in a single week. The schedule which you output must satisfy to array described above. There are several other conditions for schedule. Single professor can not conduct more than one class. Similarly, single student group can not be on more than one class at the same time. Let define a fatigue function for professors and student groups. Call this function f. To single professor fatigue calculated in the following way. Let look on classes which this professor must conduct in each of the 6-th educational days. Let x be the number of class which professor will firstly conduct in day i and let y — the last class for this professor. Then the value (2 + y - x + 1)·(2 + y - x + 1) must be added to professor's fatigue. If professor has no classes in day i, nothing is added to professor's fatigue.  For single student group fatigue is calculated similarly. Lets look at classes of this group in each of the 6 educational days. Let x be the number of first class for this group on day i and let y — the last class for this group. Then the value (2 + y - x + 1)·(2 + y - x + 1) must be added to this group's fatigue.

Your task is to come up with such a schedule which minimizes the value of function f. Jury prepared some solution of this problem. For each test you will get a certain number of points.

847,"Doubly linked list is one of the fundamental data structures. A doubly linked list is a sequence of elements, each containing information about the previous and the next elements of the list. In this problem all lists have linear structure. I.e. each element except the first has exactly one previous element, each element except the last has exactly one next element. The list is not closed in a cycle. In this problem you are given n memory cells forming one or more doubly linked lists. Each cell contains information about element from some list. Memory cells are numbered from 1 to n. For each cell i you are given two values:  If cell i contains information about the element which has no previous element then li = 0. Similarly, if cell i contains information about the element which has no next element then ri = 0. For example, for the picture above the values of l and r are the following: l1 = 4, r1 = 7; l2 = 5, r2 = 0; l3 = 0, r3 = 0; l4 = 6, r4 = 1; l5 = 0, r5 = 2; l6 = 0, r6 = 4; l7 = 1, r7 = 0. Your task is to unite all given lists in a single list, joining them to each other in any order. In particular, if the input data already contains a single list, then there is no need to perform any actions. Print the resulting list in the form of values li, ri. Any other action, other than joining the beginning of one list to the end of another, can not be performed.","The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of memory cells where the doubly linked lists are located.

Value li = 0 if element in cell i has no previous element in its list. Value ri = 0 if element in cell i has no next element in its list. It is guaranteed that the input contains the correct description of a single or more doubly linked lists. All lists have linear structure: each element of list except the first has exactly one previous element; each element of list except the last has exactly one next element. Each memory cell contains information about one element from some list, each element of each list written in one of n given cells.","Print n lines, the i-th line must contain two integers li and ri — the cells of the previous and the next element of list for cell i after all lists from the input are united in a single list.

Recently he learned that a fraction  is called proper iff its numerator is smaller than its denominator (a < b) and that the fraction is called irreducible if its numerator and its denominator are coprime (they do not have positive common divisors except 1). During his free time, Petya thinks about proper irreducible fractions and converts them to decimals using the calculator.

908,"Your friend has n cards. You know that each card has a lowercase English letter on one side and a digit on the other. Currently, your friend has laid out the cards on a table so only one side of each card is visible. You would like to know if the following statement is true for cards that your friend owns: ""If a card has a vowel on one side, then it has an even digit on the other side."" More specifically, a vowel is one of 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o' or 'u', and even digit is one of '0', '2', '4', '6' or '8'. For example, if a card has 'a' on one side, and '6' on the other side, then this statement is true for it. Also, the statement is true, for example, for a card with 'b' and '4', and for a card with 'b' and '3' (since the letter is not a vowel). The statement is false, for example, for card with 'e' and '5'. You are interested if the statement is true for all cards. In particular, if no card has a vowel, the statement is true.

927,"This is an interactive optimization problem. Instead of having to find the best answer, each solution will get score according to its efficiency. As the problem is interactive, during the testing process, the jury program and your solution will exchange messages via standard input and output streams. After printing a message, remember to flush the output buffer to ensure that the message is fully sent. For example, you can use fflush(stdout) in C++, System.out.flush() in Java, flush(output) in Pascal, and stdout.flush() in Python. Your task is to automate the next generation taxi service, BuberPool. Each Buber car may transport up to four passengers at a time. The cars have to drive to passengers' locations, pick them up and drive them to their destinations. Additionally, unlike a traditional taxi, each car can process up to four orders simultaneously. For example, when driving a passenger to the destination, a car can pick up an additional passenger, or make a detour to drop off another passenger. We will use the following simplified discrete model for this real-life problem. Consider a city as a rectangular grid of ww streets and hh avenues with w×hw×h crossroads. The streets are numbered from 11 to ww, and the avenues from 11 to hh. We will consider non-negative integer moments of time. Actions are performed in ticks: intervals of time between consecutive moments. At any moment, each car is located at some crossroads (x,y)(x,y), where 1≤x≤w1≤x≤w and 1≤y≤h1≤y≤h. Any number of cars can be at the same crossroads simultaneously. During one tick, each car can either remain on the same crossroads or change exactly one of its coordinates, the street or the avenue, by one. At moment 00, you are given starting locations of kk cars: (x1,y1)(x1,y1), (x2,y2)(x2,y2), ……, (xk,yk)(xk,yk). The number of cars is equal to kk and does not change during the simulation. Additionally, your solution will be given the clients' orders. In this problem, each order is made by a single passenger, so a car can process up to four orders at the same time. To further simplify the problem, the moments of orders are all distinct, and the orders are given in chronological order. So, each jj-th order is described by five integers: the moment tjtj, the pick up location (sxj,syj)(sxj,syj), and the drop-off location (txj,tyj)(txj,tyj). On tick 00, and also right after receiving each order, you can give instruction sets to the car drivers. Each time you can give instruction sets to any number of cars (more on restrictions later). Instruction sets for different cars are given separately. An instruction set is a sequence of triples (cx1,cy1,a1)(cx1,cy1,a1), (cx2,cy2,a2)(cx2,cy2,a2), ……, (cxm,cym,am)(cxm,cym,am), where mm is number of instructions in the set. The meaning of these numbers is as follows: When you give instruction set to a car, its previous instruction set is replaced with the new one. This way, a car only performs at most one instruction set at a time. If there are no instructions, or all of them are completed, the car is waiting at its last location. Instructions are performed in the given order. For each order, first, all the cars perform their current instruction sets until the moment of the order comes, then the order is given to your program, and after that, your program prints new instruction sets for some of the cars. The cars which don't get new instruction sets continue performing their old ones. So, the overall testing strategy looks like this: After your program exits in step 3, first, all instructions will be completely performed, and only after that the simulation will end. The score your solution gets for a test is the average score for all orders, rounded to the nearest integer. The score for an order equals α⋅(100+w0)α⋅(100+w0), where w0w0 is time the order takes in the ideal case, which is just the time to get from (sxj,syj)(sxj,syj) to (txj,tyj)(txj,tyj) (so, w0=|sxj−txj|+|syj−tyj|w0=|sxj−txj|+|syj−tyj|), and αα is a real value between 00 and 11 which characterizes the passenger's satisfaction with the ride. The value αα is calculated by the formula: α=107−min(d21+d22,107)107,α=107−min(d12+d22,107)107, where d1d1 is the waiting time before pickup (the number of ticks between the time of the order and pickup time), and d2d2 is the difference between actual and ideal travel time (the ideal travel time is w0w0). If the order was not completed, α=0α=0. The score your solution gets is just the sum of scores for each test.","The first line of input contains integers ww and hh (300≤w,h≤3000300≤w,h≤3000), the dimensions of the rectangular city. The second line contains an integer kk (1≤k≤401≤k≤40), the number of cars. Next kk lines contain integer coordinates xixi and yiyi (1≤xi≤w1≤xi≤w, 1≤yi≤h1≤yi≤h), the initial locations of cars. Recall that any number of cars can share the same location. After reading this data, your program should output the initial instruction set for the cars (see output format), and then process the orders. Each order is given on its own line and is described by five integers tjtj, sxjsxj, syjsyj, txjtxj, tyjtyj (1≤tj≤864001≤tj≤86400, 1≤sxj,txj≤w1≤sxj,txj≤w, 1≤syj,tyj≤h1≤syj,tyj≤h), where tjtj is the moment of the order, (sxj,syj)(sxj,syj) is the passenger's pickup location and (txj,tyj)(txj,tyj) is the passenger's drop-off location. Orders are sorted by strictly increasing tjtj. In each order, the pickup and drop-off locations are different. After all orders, your program is given a line with five integers −1−1. In other words, if after reading another order, tj=−1tj=−1, it means that there are no more orders. It is guaranteed that the number of orders is between 11 and 500500. After reading each order, print the instruction sets for cars. Also, print the instruction sets after reaching the line with five integers −1−1. So, if the input contains qq orders, then the number of times to print instruction sets for cars is q+2q+2 (the initial one, one after each order, and the final one). Remember that simulation is implemented in such a way that, for each order, first, all the cars perform their current instruction sets until the moment of the order comes, then the order is given to your program, and after that, your program prints new instruction sets for some of the cars. The cars which don't get new instruction sets continue performing their old ones. During main part of the contest your solution will be tested on preliminary testset of 40 tests.

There is a test generated with each generation method prepared by the jury among the published tests. After the round, last solution that has positive score on preliminary test will be used for testing. Other solutions will be ignored. All chosen solutions will be tested on secret testset, that is generated the same way (same generation methods), as preliminary tests. Jury will try to save test types and not to change statistic parameters a lot.","The output of your solution is instruction sets for the cars. Carefully read the problem statement and input format to understand the simulation process. Each of the q+2q+2 messages you print should be a sequence of integers on a single line. Each message starts with a number ff (0≤f≤k0≤f≤k), that number of cars that will receive new instructions. It should be followed by ff space separated blocks. Each block corresponds to an instruction set for a single car. A block starts with a pair of integers cc and mm (1≤c≤k1≤c≤k), the number of the car and the length of the instruction sequence for this car. Next there should be mm instructions: integer triples cx,cy,acx,cy,a (1≤cx≤w1≤cx≤w, 1≤cy≤h1≤cy≤h, −q≤a≤q−q≤a≤q), where a triple means that the car should drive to location (cx,cy)(cx,cy) and perform action aa (read the main part of the statement). Here, qq is the number of orders received so far. There should be no more than 106106 instructions in all of the output of your program. After printing the instruction sets, but before waiting for the next input, remember to flush the output buffer to ensure that the message is fully sent. For example, you can use fflush(stdout) in C++, System.out.flush() in Java, flush(output) in Pascal, and stdout.flush() in Python."

930,"In Arcady's garden there grows a peculiar apple-tree that fruits one time per year. Its peculiarity can be explained in following way: there are n inflorescences, numbered from 1 to n. Inflorescence number 1 is situated near base of tree and any other inflorescence with number i (i > 1) is situated at the top of branch, which bottom is pi-th inflorescence and pi < i. Once tree starts fruiting, there appears exactly one apple in each inflorescence. The same moment as apples appear, they start to roll down along branches to the very base of tree. Each second all apples, except ones in first inflorescence simultaneously roll down one branch closer to tree base, e.g. apple in a-th inflorescence gets to pa-th inflorescence. Apples that end up in first inflorescence are gathered by Arcady in exactly the same moment. Second peculiarity of this tree is that once two apples are in same inflorescence they annihilate. This happens with each pair of apples, e.g. if there are 5 apples in same inflorescence in same time, only one will not be annihilated and if there are 8 apples, all apples will be annihilated.

993,"You are given two squares, one with sides parallel to the coordinate axes, and another one with sides at 45 degrees to the coordinate axes. Find whether the two squares intersect. The interior of the square is considered to be part of the square, i.e. if one square is completely inside another, they intersect. If the two squares only share one common point, they are also considered to intersect.","The input data consists of two lines, one for each square, both containing 4 pairs of integers. Each pair represents coordinates of one vertex of the square. Coordinates within each line are either in clockwise or counterclockwise order.

995,"Allen dreams of one day owning a enormous fleet of electric cars, the car of the future! He knows that this will give him a big status boost. As Allen is planning out all of the different types of cars he will own and how he will arrange them, he realizes that he has a problem.  Allen's future parking lot can be represented as a rectangle with 44 rows and nn (n≤50n≤50) columns of rectangular spaces, each of which can contain at most one car at any time. He imagines having kk (k≤2nk≤2n) cars in the grid, and all the cars are initially in the second and third rows. Each of the cars also has a different designated parking space in the first or fourth row. Allen has to put the cars into corresponding parking places. However, since Allen would never entrust his cars to anyone else, only one car can be moved at a time. He can drive a car from a space in any of the four cardinal directions to a neighboring empty space. Furthermore, Allen can only move one of his cars into a space on the first or fourth rows if it is the car's designated parking space.  Allen knows he will be a very busy man, and will only have time to move cars at most 2000020000 times before he realizes that moving cars is not worth his time. Help Allen determine if he should bother parking his cars or leave it to someone less important.","The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers nn and kk (1≤n≤501≤n≤50, 1≤k≤2n1≤k≤2n), representing the number of columns and the number of cars, respectively. The next four lines will contain nn integers each between 00 and kk inclusive, representing the initial state of the parking lot. The rows are numbered 11 to 44 from top to bottom and the columns are numbered 11 to nn from left to right. In the first and last line, an integer 1≤x≤k1≤x≤k represents a parking spot assigned to car xx (you can only move this car to this place), while the integer 00 represents a empty space (you can't move any car to this place). In the second and third line, an integer 1≤x≤k1≤x≤k represents initial position of car xx, while the integer 00 represents an empty space (you can move any car to this place). Each xx between 11 and kk appears exactly once in the second and third line, and exactly once in the first and fourth line.","If there is a sequence of moves that brings all of the cars to their parking spaces, with at most 2000020000 car moves, then print mm, the number of moves, on the first line. On the following mm lines, print the moves (one move per line) in the format ii rr cc, which corresponds to Allen moving car ii to the neighboring space at row rr and column cc. If it is not possible for Allen to move all the cars to the correct spaces with at most 2000020000 car moves, print a single line with the integer −1−1."

999,"Mishka started participating in a programming contest. There are nn problems in the contest. Mishka's problem-solving skill is equal to kk. Mishka arranges all problems from the contest into a list. Because of his weird principles, Mishka only solves problems from one of the ends of the list. Every time, he chooses which end (left or right) he will solve the next problem from. Thus, each problem Mishka solves is either the leftmost or the rightmost problem in the list. Mishka cannot solve a problem with difficulty greater than kk. When Mishka solves the problem, it disappears from the list, so the length of the list decreases by 11. Mishka stops when he is unable to solve any problem from any end of the list.
