In Ancient Berland arenas in circuses were shaped as a regular       (equiangular) polygon, the size and the number of angles could       vary from one circus to another. In each corner of the arena there       was a special pillar, and the rope strung between the pillars       marked the arena edges. Recently the scientists from Berland have discovered the remains       of the ancient circus arena. They found only three pillars, the       others were destroyed by the time. You are given the coordinates of these three pillars. Find out       what is the smallest area that the arena could have.","The input file consists of three lines, each of them contains a       pair of numbers –– coordinates of the pillar.

As all the       sport competitions are of the same importance, the stadiums should       be observed at the same angle. If the number of points meeting the       conditions is more than one, the point with the maximum angle of       observation is prefered.  Would you, please, help the famous Berland commentator G.

39,"There are lots of theories concerning the origin of moon craters.       Most scientists stick to the meteorite theory, which says that the       craters were formed as a result of celestial bodies colliding with       the Moon. The other version is that the craters were parts of volcanoes. An extraterrestrial intelligence research specialist professor       Okulov (the namesake of the Okulov, the author of famous textbooks       on programming) put forward an alternate hypothesis. Guess what       kind of a hypothesis it was –– sure, the one including       extraterrestrial mind involvement. Now the professor is looking       for proofs of his hypothesis. Professor has data from the moon robot that moves linearly in one       direction along the Moon surface. The moon craters are circular in       form with integer-valued radii. The moon robot records only the       craters whose centers lay on his path and sends to the Earth the       information on the distance from the centers of the craters to the       initial point of its path and on the radii of the craters. According to the theory of professor Okulov two craters made by       an extraterrestrial intelligence for the aims yet unknown either       are fully enclosed one in the other or do not intersect at all.

So, Vasya leaves city A on the Huff-puffer, besides, at the very       beginning he fills the petrol tank with α liters of petrol (α ≥ 10 is Vanya's favorite number, it is       not necessarily integer). Petrol stations are located on the       motorway at an interval of 100       kilometers, i.e. the first station is located 100 kilometers away from the city A, the       second one is 200 kilometers away       from the city A, the third one is 300 kilometers away from the city A and so       on. The Huff-puffer spends 10 liters       of petrol every 100 kilometers.  Vanya checks the petrol tank every time he passes by a petrol       station. If the petrol left in the tank is not enough to get to       the next station, Vanya fills the tank with α liters of petrol. Otherwise, he doesn't       stop at the station and drives on.  For example, if α = 43.21, then the       car will be fuelled up for the first time at the station number         4, when there'll be 3.21 petrol liters left. After the       fuelling up the car will have 46.42       liters. Then Vanya stops at the station number 8 and ends up with 6.42 + 43.21 = 49.63 liters. The next stop       is at the station number 12, 9.63 + 43.21 = 52.84. The next stop is at       the station number 17 and so on.

By the arrival       of the President of Berland these trees were decided to be changed       so that their heights formed a beautiful sequence. This       means that the heights of trees on ends (the 1st one and the  n-th one) should be equal to each other, the       heights of the 2-nd and the (n - 1)-th tree must also be equal       to each other, at that the height of the 2-nd tree should be larger than the height       of the first tree by 1, and so on.       In other words, the heights of the trees, standing at equal       distance from the edge (of one end of the sequence) must be equal       to each other, and with the increasing of the distance from the       edge by 1 the tree height must also       increase by 1.

Now their senior army general, Philip is captured by Shapur and       Shapur is now going to capture Valerian, the Roman emperor. Being defeated, the cowardly Valerian hid in a room at the top of       one of his castles. To capture him, Shapur has to open many doors.       Fortunately Valerian was too scared to make impenetrable locks for       the doors. Each door has 4 parts. The first       part is an integer number  a. The second part is either an integer number          b or some really odd sign which looks like R. The third one is an integer          c and the fourth part is empty!

By the end of the       15-th century the population of black cats ceased to exist. The       difficulty of the situation led to creating the EIC - the       Emergency Inquisitory Commission. The resolution #666 says that a white cat is considered black       when and only when the perimeter of its black spots exceeds the       acceptable norm. But what does the acceptable norm equal to? Every       inquisitor will choose it himself depending on the situation. And       your task is to find the perimeter of black spots on the cat's fur.

The thinker thinks of a four-digit number in the decimal system.       All the digits in the number are different and the number may have       a leading zero. It can't have more than one leading zero, because       all it's digits should be different. The guesser tries to guess       the number. He makes a series of guesses, trying experimental       numbers and receives answers from the first person in the format         "" x bulls  y cows"".  x represents the number of digits in the       experimental number that occupy the same positions as in the       sought number.  y represents the number of digits of the       experimental number that present in the sought number, but occupy       different positions. Naturally, the experimental numbers, as well       as the sought number, are represented by four-digit numbers where       all digits are different and a leading zero can be present.

He decided to calculate what folder contains most       subfolders (including nested folders, nested folders of nested       folders, and so on) and what folder contains most files (including       the files in the subfolders). More formally, the subfolders of the folder are all its directly       nested folders and the subfolders of these nested folders. The       given folder is not considered the subfolder of itself. A file is       regarded as lying in a folder, if and only if it either lies       directly in this folder, or lies in some subfolder of the folder. For a better understanding of how to count subfolders and files       for calculating the answer, see notes and answers to the samples. You are given a few files that Petya has managed to create. The       path to each file looks as follows:   diskName:\  folder 1 \  folder 2 \...\  folder  n \  fileName  It is also known that there is no file whose path looks like          diskName:\  fileName. That is, each file is stored in some       folder, but there are no files directly in the root. Also let us       assume that the disk root is not a folder.

Note that the disks are not regarded as folders.","In the first sample we have one folder on the ""C"" disk. It has no       subfolders, which is why the first number in the answer is 0. But this folder contains one file, so       the second number of the answer is 1. In the second sample we have several different folders. Consider       the ""folder1""       folder on the ""C""       disk. This folder directly contains one folder, ""folder2"". The ""folder2"" folder contains two       more folders — ""folder3"" and ""folder4"". Thus, the         ""folder1""       folder on the ""C""       drive has exactly 3 subfolders. Also       this folder contains two files, even though they do not lie       directly in the folder, but they are located in subfolders of         ""folder1"". In the third example we see that the names of some folders and       some subfolders are identical. Consider the ""file"" folder, which lies       directly on the ""C"" disk. That folder       contains another ""file"" folder, which in turn       contains another ""file"" folder, which contains       two more folders, ""file"" and ""file2"".

It is known that every pipe has three       attributes: the minimum amount of fuel that should go through it,       the maximum amount of fuel that can possibly go through it and the       cost of pipe activation. If  c  ij units of fuel ( c  ij > 0) flow from node  i to node  j, it will cost  a  ij + c  ij 2 tugriks ( a  ij is the cost of pipe activation), and if       fuel doesn't flow through the pipe, it doesn't cost anything. Only       integer number of units of fuel can flow through each pipe. Constraints on the minimal and the maximal fuel capacity of a       pipe take place always, not       only if it is active. You may assume that the pipe is active if       and only if the flow through it is strictly greater than zero. Petya doesn't want the pipe system to be overloaded, so he wants       to find the minimal amount of fuel, that, having entered the first       node, can reach the synchrophasotron. Besides that he wants to       impress the sponsors, so the sum of money needed to be paid for       fuel to go through each pipe, must be as big as possible.","First line contains integer  n (2 ≤ n ≤ 6), which represents the       number of nodes. Each of the next  n(n - 1) / 2 lines contains five integers          s, f, l, h, a that       describe pipes — the first node of the pipe, the second node of       the pipe, the minimum and the maximum amount of fuel that can flow       through the pipe and the the activation cost, respectively. (1 ≤ s < f ≤ n, 0 ≤ l ≤ h ≤ 5, 0 ≤ a ≤ 6).       It is guaranteed that for each pair of nodes with distinct numbers       there will be exactly one pipe between them described in the input.","Output in the first line two space-separated numbers: the minimum       possible amount of fuel that can flow into the synchrophasotron,       and the maximum possible sum that needs to be paid in order for       that amount of fuel to reach synchrophasotron. If there is no       amount of fuel that can reach synchrophasotron, output ""-1 -1"". The amount of fuel which will flow into synchrophasotron is not       neccessary positive. It could be equal to zero if the minimum       constraint of every pipe is equal to zero.","In the first test, we can either pass 1 or 2 units of fuel from       node 1 to node 2. The minimum possible amount is 1, it costs  a 12 + 12 = 4. In the second test, you can pass at most 2 units from node 1 to       node 2, and at you have to pass at least 3 units from node 2 to       node 3. It is impossible. In the third test, the minimum possible amount is 2. You can pass       each unit of fuel through two different paths: either       1->2->3->4 or 1->3->4. If you use the first path       twice, it will cost  a 12 + 22 + a 23 + 22 + a 34 + 22=14. If you use the second path       twice, it will cost  a 13 + 22 + a 34 + 22=14. However, if you use each       path (allowing one unit of fuel go through pipes 1->2, 2->3,       1->3, and two units go through 3->4) it will cost  a 12 + 12 + a 23 + 12 + a 13 + 12 + a 34 + 22=15 and it is the maximum       possible cost. Also note that since no fuel flows from node 1 to node 4,       activation cost for that pipe is not added to the answer."

74,"Let's imagine: there is a chess piece billiard ball. Its movements       resemble the ones of a bishop chess piece. The only difference is       that when a billiard ball hits the board's border, it can reflect       from it and continue moving. More formally, first one of four diagonal directions is chosen       and the billiard ball moves in that direction. When it reaches the       square located on the board's edge, the billiard ball reflects       from it; it changes the direction of its movement by 90 degrees       and continues moving. Specifically, having reached a corner       square, the billiard ball is reflected twice and starts to move       the opposite way. While it moves, the billiard ball can make an       infinite number of reflections. At any square of its trajectory       the billiard ball can stop and on that the move is considered completed.

Genome of organism from this       planet can be represented as a string of the first  K capital English letters.

The gene 'A' has       index 1, 'B' has index 2 and so on. For example,  a 3, 2 stands for the risk       of 'CB' fragment. Risk of disease occurence in the organism is       equal to the sum of risks for each pair of adjacent genes in the genome. Scientists have already obtained a base organism. Some new       organisms can be obtained by mutation of this organism. Mutation       involves removal of all genes of some particular types.

77," ""Eat a beaver, save a         tree!"" — That will be the motto of ecologists' urgent         meeting in Beaverley Hills.  And the whole point is that the         population of beavers on the Earth has reached incredible sizes!         Each day their number increases in several times and they don't         even realize how much their unhealthy obsession with trees harms         the nature and the humankind. The amount of oxygen in the         atmosphere has dropped to 17 per cent and, as the best minds of         the world think, that is not the end.  In the middle of the 50-s of the         previous century a group of soviet scientists succeed in         foreseeing the situation with beavers and worked out a secret         technology to clean territory. The technology bears a mysterious         title ""Beavermuncher-0xFF"". Now the fate of the planet         lies on the fragile shoulders of a small group of people who has         dedicated their lives to science.  The prototype is ready, you now         need to urgently carry out its experiments in practice.  You are given a tree, completely occupied by beavers. A tree is a       connected undirected graph without cycles. The tree consists of          n vertices, the  i-th vertex contains  k  i beavers.  ""Beavermuncher-0xFF"" works by the following principle:       being at some vertex  u, it can go to the vertex  v, if they are connected by an edge, and eat exactly one beaver located at       the vertex  v. It is impossible to move to the vertex  v if there are no beavers left in  v. ""Beavermuncher-0xFF"" cannot just stand at some vertex       and eat beavers in it. ""Beavermuncher-0xFF"" must move       without stops. Why does the ""Beavermuncher-0xFF"" works like this?       Because the developers have not provided place for the battery in       it and eating beavers is necessary for converting their mass into       pure energy. It is guaranteed that the beavers will be shocked by what is       happening, which is why they will not be able to move from a       vertex of the tree to another one. As for the       ""Beavermuncher-0xFF"", it can move along each edge in       both directions while conditions described above are fulfilled. The root of the tree is located at the vertex  s. This means that the       ""Beavermuncher-0xFF"" begins its mission at the vertex          s and it must return there at the end of       experiment, because no one is going to take it down from a high       place.  Determine the maximum number of beavers       ""Beavermuncher-0xFF"" can eat and return to the starting vertex.",The first line contains integer  n — the number of vertices in the tree (1 ≤ n ≤ 105).

Each team       member will receive a        of experience, rounded down, where  x will be the amount of experience for the killed       megaboss and  y — the number of people in the team. Heroes do not want to hurt each other's feelings, so they want to       split into teams so that the difference between the hero who       received the maximum number of experience and the hero who       received the minimum number of experience were minimal. Since       there can be several divisions into teams, then you need to find       the one in which the total         amount of liking in teams were maximum. It is known that some heroes like others.

The total amount of liking in teams is the amount of ordered       pairs (p, q), such       that heroes  p and  q are in the same group, and hero  p likes hero  q (but it is not important if hero  q likes hero  p). In case of heroes  p and  q likes each other and they are in the same group,       this pair should be counted twice, as (p, q) and (q, p). A team can consist even of a single hero, but it is important       that every megaboss was destroyed. All heroes must be involved in       the campaign against evil. None of the heroes can be in more than       one team. It is guaranteed that every hero is able to destroy any megaboss alone.","The first line contains a single non-negative integer  n (0 ≤ n ≤ 42) — amount of liking       between the heroes. Next  n lines describe liking in the form ""p likes q"", meaning that       the hero p likes the hero         q (p  ≠  q). Every liking is described in       the input exactly once, no hero likes himself. In the last line are given three integers  a,  b and  c (1 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 2·109), separated by spaces: the       experience for Mephisto, the experience for Diablo and experience       for Baal. In all the pretests, except for examples from the statement, the       following condition is satisfied:  a = b = c.","Print two integers — the minimal difference in the experience       between two heroes who will receive the maximum and minimum number       of experience points, and the maximal total amount of liking in       teams (the number of friendships between heroes that end up in one team).  When calculating the second         answer, the team division should satisfy the         difference-minimizing contraint. I.e. primary you should         minimize the difference in the experience and secondary you         should maximize the total amount of liking."," A note to first example: it       the first team should be Dracul, Troll and Anka, in the second one Hexadecimal and Snowy, and in the third Cleo и Chapay."
81,"After the educational reform Polycarp studies only two subjects       at school, Safety Studies and PE (Physical Education). During the       long months of the fourth term, he received  n marks in them. When teachers wrote a mark in the       journal, they didn't write in what subject the mark was for, they       just wrote the mark. Now it's time to show the journal to his strict parents. Polycarp       knows that recently at the Parent Meeting the parents were told       that he received  a Safety Studies marks and  b PE marks ( a + b = n). Now Polycarp wants to       write a subject's name in front of each mark so that:  An average subject grade is the sum of all marks in it, divided       by the number of them. Of course, the division is performed in       real numbers without rounding up or down. Polycarp aims to       maximize the  x 1 + x 2, where  x 1 is the average score in       the first subject (Safety Studies), and  x 2 is the average score in       the second one (Physical Education).","The first line contains an integer  n (2 ≤ n ≤ 105),  n is the number of marks in Polycarp's Journal.

82,"The Berland Kingdom is a set of  n cities connected with each other with  n - 1 railways. Each road connects exactly two       different cities. The capital is located in city 1. For each city there is a way to get       from there to the capital by rail. In the  i-th city there is a soldier division number  i, each division is characterized by a number of          a  i. It represents the priority, the smaller       the number, the higher the priority of this division. All values       of  a  i are different. One day the Berland King Berl Great declared a general       mobilization, and for that, each division should arrive in the       capital. Every day from every city except the capital a train       departs. So there are exactly  n - 1 departing trains each day. Each train moves       toward the capital and finishes movement on the opposite endpoint       of the railway on the next day. It has some finite capacity of          c  j, expressed in the maximum number of       divisions, which this train can transport in one go. Each train       moves in the direction of reducing the distance to the capital. So       each train passes exactly one railway moving from a city to the       neighboring (where it stops) toward the capital. In the first place among the divisions that are in the city,       division with the smallest number of  a  i get on the train, then with the next       smallest and so on, until either the train is full or all the       divisions are be loaded. So it is possible for a division to stay       in a city for a several days. The duration of train's progress from one city to another is       always equal to 1 day. All divisions       start moving at the same time and end up in the capital, from       where they don't go anywhere else any more. Each division moves       along a simple path from its city to the capital, regardless of       how much time this journey will take.

83,"You already know that Valery's favorite sport is biathlon. Due to       your help, he learned to shoot without missing, and his skills are       unmatched at the shooting range. But now a smaller task is to be       performed, he should learn to complete the path fastest. The track's map is represented by a rectangle  n × m in size divided into squares. Each       square is marked with a lowercase Latin letter (which means the       type of the plot), with the exception of the starting square (it       is marked with a capital Latin letters  S) and the terminating square (it is marked with a       capital Latin letter  T). The time of movement from one square to       another is equal to 1 minute. The       time of movement within the cell can be neglected. We can move       from the cell only to side-adjacent ones, but it is forbidden to       go beyond the map edges. Also the following restriction is imposed       on the path: it is not allowed to visit more than  k different       types of squares (squares of one type can be visited an       infinite number of times). Squares marked with  S and  T have no type, so they are not counted. But  S must be visited exactly once — at the very       beginning, and  T must be visited exactly once — at the very end. Your task is to find the path from the square  S to the square  T that takes minimum time. Among all shortest       paths you should choose the lexicographically minimal one.       When comparing paths you should lexicographically represent them       as a sequence of characters, that is, of plot types.","The first input line contains three integers  n,  m and  k (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 50, n·m ≥ 2, 1 ≤ k ≤ 4).

84,"Perhaps many have heard that the World Biathlon Championship has       finished. Although our hero Valera was not present at this       spectacular event himself and only watched it on TV, it excited       him so much that he decided to enroll in a biathlon section. Of course, biathlon as any sport, proved very difficult in       practice. It takes much time and effort. Workouts, workouts, and       workouts, — that's what awaited Valera on his way to great       achievements in biathlon. As for the workouts, you all probably know that every       professional biathlete should ski fast and shoot precisely at the       shooting range. Only in this case you can hope to be successful,       because running and shooting are the two main components of       biathlon. Valera has been diligent in his ski trainings, which is       why he runs really fast, however, his shooting accuracy is nothing       to write home about. On a biathlon base where Valera is preparing for the competition,       there is a huge rifle range with  n targets. Each target have shape of a circle, and         the center of each circle is         located on the  Ox axis. At the last training session       Valera made the total of  m shots. To make monitoring of his own results       easier for him, one rather well-known programmer (of course it is       you) was commissioned to write a program that would reveal how       many and which targets Valera hit. More specifically, for each       target the program must print the number of the first successful shot (in       the target), or ""-1"" if this was not hit. The target is considered hit if the         shot is inside the circle or on its boundary. Valera is       counting on you and perhaps, thanks to you he will one day win       international competitions.","The first line of the input file contains the integer  n (1 ≤ n ≤ 104), which is the number of       targets. The next  n lines contain descriptions of the targets. Each       target is a circle whose center is located on the  Ox axis. Each circle is given by its coordinate of       the center  x ( - 2·104 ≤ x ≤ 2·104) and its radius  r (1 ≤ r ≤ 1000).

85,"One night, having had a hard day at work, Petya saw a nightmare.       There was a binary search tree in the dream. But it was not the       actual tree that scared Petya. The horrifying thing was that Petya       couldn't search for elements in this tree. Petya tried many times       to choose key and look for it in the tree, and each time he       arrived at a wrong place. Petya has been racking his brains for       long, choosing keys many times, but the result was no better. But       the moment before Petya would start to despair, he had an       epiphany: every time he was looking for keys, the tree didn't have       the key, and occured exactly one mistake. ""That's not a       problem!"", thought Petya. ""Why not count the expectation       value of an element, which is found when I search for the       key"". The moment he was about to do just that, however, Petya       suddenly woke up. Thus, you are given a binary search tree, that       is a tree containing some number written in the node. This number       is called the node       key. The number of children of every node of the tree is       equal either to 0 or to 2. The nodes that have 0 children are called leaves and the nodes that       have 2 children, are called inner. An inner node has       the left child, that       is the child whose key is less than the current node's key, and       the right child,       whose key is more than the current node's key. Also, a key of any       node is strictly larger than all the keys of the left subtree of       the node and strictly smaller than all the keys of the right       subtree of the node. Also you are given a set of search keys, all of       which are distinct and differ from the node keys contained in the       tree. For each key from the set its search in the tree is       realised. The search is arranged like this: initially we are       located in the tree root, if the key of the current node is larger       that our search key, then we move to the left child of the node,       otherwise we go to the right child of the node and the process is       repeated. As it is guaranteed that the search key is not contained       in the tree, the search will always finish in some leaf. The key       lying in the leaf is declared the search result. It is known for sure that during the search we make a mistake in       comparing exactly once, that is we go the wrong way, but we won't       make any mistakes later. All possible mistakes are equiprobable,       that is we should consider all such searches where exactly one       mistake occurs. Your task is to find the expectation (the average       value) of the search result for every search key, considering that       exactly one mistake occurs in the search. That is, for a set of       paths containing exactly one mistake in the given key search, you       should count the average value of keys containing in the leaves of       those paths.","The first line contains an odd integer  n (3 ≤ n < 105), which represents the number       of tree nodes.

We will further think of a DNA sequence as an arbitrary       string of uppercase letters ""A"", ""C"", ""G"" and ""T"" (of course, this is a       simplified interpretation). Let  w be a long DNA sequence and  s 1, s 2, ..., s  m — collection of short DNA sequences. Let       us say that the collection filters  w iff  w can be covered with the sequences from the       collection. Certainly, substrings corresponding to the different       positions of the string may intersect or even cover each other.       More formally: denote by |w|       the length of  w, let symbols of  w be numbered from 1       to |w|. Then for each       position  i in  w there exist pair of indices  l, r (1 ≤ l ≤ i ≤ r ≤ |w|)       such that the substring  w[l ... r] equals one of the       elements  s 1, s 2, ..., s  m of the collection.

Let the trains start to go       at the zero moment of time. It is clear that the moments of the       trains' arrival will be periodic with period 6.

If he descends to the subway at a moment of time from 0 to 2, he       leaves for Dasha on the train that arrives by the second minute. If he descends to the subway at a moment of time from 2 to 3, he       leaves for Masha on the train that arrives by the third minute. If he descends to the subway at a moment of time from 3 to 4, he       leaves for Dasha on the train that arrives by the fourth minute. If he descends to the subway at a moment of time from 4 to 6, he       waits for both trains to arrive by the sixth minute and goes to       Masha as trains go less often in Masha's direction. In sum Masha and Dasha get equal time — three minutes for each       one, thus, Vasya will go to both girlfriends equally often."

91,"A ski base is planned to be built in Walrusland. Recently,       however, the project is still in the constructing phase. A large       land lot was chosen for the construction. It contains  n ski junctions, numbered from 1 to  n. Initially the junctions aren't connected in any way. In the constructing process  m bidirectional ski roads will be built. The roads       are built one after another: first the road number 1 will be built, then the road number         2, and so on. The  i-th road connects the junctions with numbers          a  i and  b  i.  Track is the route       with the following properties:  Let's consider the ski       base as a non-empty set of roads that can be divided into       one or more tracks so that exactly one track went along each road       of the chosen set. Besides, each track can consist only of roads       from the chosen set. Ski base doesn't have to be connected. Two ski bases are considered different if they consist of       different road sets.

93,"After the Search Ultimate program that searched for strings in a       text failed, Igor K. got to think: ""Why on Earth does my       program work so slowly?"" As he double-checked his code, he       said: ""My code contains no errors, yet I know how we will       improve Search Ultimate!"" and took a large book from the       shelves. The book read ""Azembler. Principally New Approach"". Having carefully thumbed through the book, Igor K. realised that,       as it turns out, you can multiply the numbers dozens of times       faster. ""Search Ultimate will be faster than it has ever       been!"" — the fellow shouted happily and set to work. Let us now clarify what Igor's idea was. The thing is that the       code that was generated by a compiler was far from perfect.       Standard multiplying does work slower than with the trick the book mentioned. The Azembler language operates with 26 registers (eax, ebx, ...,       ezx) and two commands:  On the first thought the second operation seems meaningless, but       as it turns out, it is acceptable to write the operation as  lea ecx, [eax + ebx], lea ecx, [k*eax] or even lea ecx, [ebx + k*eax], where k = 1, 2, 4 or 8. As a result, the register ecx will be equal to the numbers eax +       ebx, k*eax and ebx + k*eax correspondingly. However, such       operation is fulfilled many times, dozens of times faster that the       usual multiplying of numbers. And using several such operations,       one can very quickly multiply some number by some other one. Of       course, instead of eax, ebx and ecx you are allowed to use any registers. For example, let the eax register contain some number that we       should multiply by 41. It takes us 2 lines: lea ebx, [eax + 4*eax] // now ebx = 5*eax lea eax, [eax + 8*ebx] // now eax = eax + 8*ebx = 41*eax Igor K. got interested in the following question: what is the       minimum number of lea operations needed to multiply by the given       number  n and how to do it? Your task is to help him. Consider that at the initial moment of time eax contains a number       that Igor K. was about to multiply by  n, and the registers from ebx to ezx contain       number 0. At the final moment of time the result can be located in       any register.","The input data contain the only integer  n (1 ≤ n ≤ 255), which Igor K. is       about to multiply.","On the first line print number  p, which represents the minimum number of lea       operations, needed to do that. Then print the program consisting       of  p commands, performing the operations. It is       guaranteed that such program exists for any  n from 1 to 255. Use precisely the following format of commands (here  k is equal to 1, 2, 4 or 8, and  x,  y and  z are any, even coinciding registers): lea x, [y] lea x, [y + z] lea x, [k*y] lea x, [y + k*z] Please note that extra spaces at         the end of a command are unacceptable.",

The city has  n junctions, some of which are connected by       two-way roads. The length of each road is defined by some positive       integer number of meters; the roads can have different lengths. Initially each junction has exactly one taxi standing there. The       taxi driver from the  i-th junction agrees to drive Petya (perhaps       through several intermediate junctions) to some other junction if       the travel distance is not more than  t  i meters. Also, the cost of the ride       doesn't depend on the distance and is equal to  c  i bourles. Taxis can't stop in the middle       of a road. Each taxi can be used         no more than once.

96,"Petya loves hockey very much. One day, as he was watching a       hockey match, he fell asleep. Petya dreamt of being appointed to       change a hockey team's name. Thus, Petya was given the original       team name  w and the collection of forbidden substrings  s 1, s 2, ..., s  n. All those strings consist of uppercase       and lowercase Latin letters. String  w has the length of |w|, its characters are numbered       from 1 to |w|. First Petya should find all the occurrences of forbidden       substrings in the  w string. During the search of substrings the case       of letter shouldn't be taken into consideration. That is, strings         ""aBC"" and         ""ABc"" are       considered equal. After that Petya should perform the replacement of all letters       covered by the occurrences. More formally: a letter in the       position  i should be replaced by any other one if for       position  i in string  w there exist pair of indices  l, r (1 ≤ l ≤ i ≤ r ≤ |w|)       such that substring  w[l ... r] is contained in the       collection  s 1, s 2, ..., s  n, when using case insensitive comparison.       During the replacement the letter's case should remain the same.       Petya is not allowed to replace the letters that aren't covered by       any forbidden substring. Letter  letter (uppercase or lowercase) is considered       lucky for the hockey players.

97,"One university has just found out about a sport programming       contest called ACM ICPC v2.0. This contest doesn't differ much       from the well-known ACM ICPC, for example, the participants are       not allowed to take part in the finals more than two times.       However, there is one notable difference: the teams in the contest       should consist of exactly  n participants. Having taken part in several ACM ICPC v2.0 finals and having not       won any medals, the students and the university governors realized       that it's high time they changed something about the preparation       process. Specifically, as the first innovation it was decided to       change the teams' formation process. Having spent considerable       amount of time on studying the statistics of other universities'       performance, they managed to receive some interesting information:       the dependence between the probability of winning a medal and the       number of team members that participated in the finals in the       past. More formally, we know  n + 1 real numbers  p 0 ≤ p 1 ≤ ... ≤ p  n, where  p  i is the probability of getting a medal on       the finals if the team has  i participants of previous finals, and other  n - i participants arrived to the finals       for the first time.

And how about you, can you offer such optimal tactic? At the first       stage the university governors want to know the value of maximum       average probability. More formally, suppose that the university sends a team to the          k-th world finals. The team has  a  k participants of previous finals (0 ≤ a  k ≤ n).

However, his unusual name is not the weirdest thing       (besides, everyone long ago got used to calling him simply Dwarf       Greg). What is special about Dwarf Greg — he's been living for       over 200 years; besides, he lives in a crypt on an abandoned       cemetery and nobody has ever seen him out in daytime. Moreover,       nobody has ever seen Greg buy himself any food. That's why nobody       got particularly surprised when after the infernal dragon's tragic       death cattle continued to disappear from fields. The people in the       neighborhood were long sure that the harmless dragon was never       responsible for disappearing cattle (considering that the dragon       used to be sincere about his vegetarian views). But even that's       not the worst part of the whole story. The worst part is that merely several minutes ago Dwarf Greg in       some unintelligible way got inside your house and asked you to       help him solve a problem. The point is that a short time ago Greg       decided to order a new coffin (knowing his peculiar character, you       are not surprised at all). But the problem is: a very long in both       directions L-shaped corridor leads to Greg's crypt, and you can't       drag just any coffin through that corridor. That's why he asked       you to help. You've formalized the task on a plane like this: let the       corridor's width before and after the turn be equal to  a and  b correspondingly (see the picture). The corridor       turns directly at a right angle, the coffin is a rectangle whose       length and width are equal to  l and  w ( l ≥ w) correspondingly. Dwarf Greg has       already determined the coffin's length ( l), which is based on his height; your task is to       determine the coffin's maximally possible width ( w), at which it can be brought to the crypt.       Besides, due to its large mass (pure marble!) the coffin is       equipped with rotating wheels; therefore it is impossible to lift       it off the ground, however, arbitrary moves and rotations of the       coffin in the plane become possible. The coffin may be rotated       arbitrarily just before you drag it into crypt and move through       the corridor. Greg promised that if you help him, he will grant you immortality       (I wonder how?).

However, as       Gerald is too lazy, he has no desire whatsoever to learn those       letters. That's why he decided to lose some part of the string       (not necessarily a connected part). The lost part can consist of       any number of segments of any length, at any distance from each       other. However, Gerald knows that if he loses more than  k characters, it will be very suspicious.  Find the least number of distinct characters that can remain in       the string after no more than  k characters are deleted. You also have to find       any possible way to delete the characters.",The first input data line contains a string whose length is equal       to  n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105). The string consists of       lowercase Latin letters. The second line contains the number  k (0 ≤ k ≤ 105).,"Print on the first line the only number  m — the least possible number of different       characters that could remain in the given string after it loses no       more than  k characters. Print on the second line the string that Gerald can get after       some characters are lost. The string should have exactly  m distinct characters. The final string should be       the subsequence of the initial string. If Gerald can get several       different strings with exactly  m distinct characters, print any of them.","In the first sample the string consists of five identical letters       but you are only allowed to delete 4 of them so that there was at       least one letter left. Thus, the right answer is 1 and any string       consisting of characters ""a"" from 1 to 5 in length. In the second sample you are allowed to delete 4 characters. You       cannot delete all the characters, because the string has length       equal to 7. However, you can delete all characters apart from         ""a"" (as they       are no more than four), which will result in the ""aaaa"" string. In the third sample you are given a line whose length is equal to       8, and  k = 10, so that the whole line can be deleted. The       correct answer is 0 and an empty string."
103,"After all the events in Orlando we all know, Sasha and Roma       decided to find out who is still the team's biggest loser.       Thankfully, Masha found somewhere a revolver with a rotating       cylinder of  n bullet slots able to contain exactly  k bullets, now the boys have a chance to resolve       the problem once and for all.  Sasha selects any  k out of  n slots he wishes and puts bullets there. Roma       spins the cylinder so that every of  n possible cylinder's shifts is equiprobable. Then       the game starts, the players take turns, Sasha starts: he puts the       gun to his head and shoots. If there was no bullet in front of the       trigger, the cylinder shifts by one position and the weapon is       given to Roma for make the same move. The game continues until       someone is shot, the survivor is the winner.  Sasha does not want to lose, so he must choose slots for bullets       in such a way as to minimize the probability of its own loss. Of       all the possible variant he wants to select the lexicographically       minimal one, where an empty slot is lexicographically less than a       charged one.  More formally, the cylinder of  n bullet slots able to contain  k bullets can be represented as a string of  n characters. Exactly  k of them are ""X"" (charged slots) and the       others are "".""       (uncharged slots).  Let us describe the process of a shot. Suppose that the trigger       is in front of the first character of the string (the first slot).       If a shot doesn't kill anyone and the cylinder shifts, then the       string shifts left. So the first character becomes the last one,       the second character becomes the first one, and so on. But the       trigger doesn't move. It will be in front of the first character       of the resulting string. Among all the strings that give the minimal probability of loss,       Sasha choose the lexicographically minimal one. According to this       very string, he charges the gun. You have to help Sasha to charge       the gun.

104,"...Once upon a time a man came to the sea. The sea was stormy and       dark. The man started to call for the little mermaid to appear but       alas, he only woke up Cthulhu... Whereas on the other end of the world Pentagon is actively       collecting information trying to predict the monster's behavior       and preparing the secret super weapon. Due to high seismic       activity and poor weather conditions the satellites haven't yet       been able to make clear shots of the monster. The analysis of the       first shot resulted in an undirected graph with  n vertices and  m edges. Now the world's best minds are about to       determine whether this graph can be regarded as Cthulhu or not. To add simplicity, let's suppose that Cthulhu looks from the       space like some spherical body with tentacles attached to it.       Formally, we shall regard as Cthulhu such an undirected graph that       can be represented as a set of three or more rooted trees, whose       roots are connected by a simple cycle.

105,"Each item in the game has a level. The higher the level is, the       higher basic parameters the item has. We shall consider only the       following basic parameters: attack (atk), defense (def) and resistance to different       types of impact (res). Each item belongs to one class. In this problem we will only       consider three of such classes: weapon, armor, orb. Besides, there's a whole new world hidden inside each item. We       can increase an item's level travelling to its world. We can also       capture the so-called residents in the Item World Residents are the creatures that live inside items. Each resident       gives some bonus to the item in which it is currently located. We       will only consider residents of types: gladiator (who improves the       item's atk), sentry (who improves def) and physician (who improves res). Each item has the size parameter. The parameter limits the       maximum number of residents that can live inside an item. We can       move residents between items. Within one moment of time we can       take some resident from an item and move it to some other item if       it has a free place for a new resident.

107,"In the year 2500 the annual graduation ceremony in the German       University in Cairo (GUC) has run smoothly for almost 500 years so far. The most important part of the ceremony is related to the       arrangement of the professors in the ceremonial hall. Traditionally GUC has  n professors. Each professor has his seniority       level. All seniorities are different. Let's enumerate the       professors from 1 to  n, with 1 being the       most senior professor and  n being the most junior professor. The ceremonial hall has  n seats, one seat for each professor. Some places       in this hall are meant for more senior professors than the others.       More specifically,  m pairs of seats are in ""senior-junior""       relation, and the tradition requires that for all  m pairs of seats (a  i, b  i) the professor seated in       ""senior"" position  a  i should be more senior than the professor       seated in ""junior"" position  b  i. GUC is very strict about its traditions, which have been       carefully observed starting from year 2001. The tradition requires       that:  The arrangement of the professors is the list of  n integers, where the first integer is the       seniority of the professor seated in position number one, the       second integer is the seniority of the professor seated in       position number two, etc. Given  n, the number of professors,  y, the current year and  m pairs of restrictions, output the arrangement of       the professors for this year.","The first line contains three integers  n,  y and  m (1 ≤ n ≤ 16, 2001 ≤ y ≤ 1018, 0 ≤ m ≤ 100) — the       number of professors, the year for which the arrangement should be       computed, and the number of pairs of seats for which the seniority       relation should be kept, respectively.

108,"The German University in Cairo (GUC) dorm houses are numbered       from 1 to  n. Underground water pipes connect these houses       together. Each pipe has certain direction (water can flow only in       this direction and not vice versa), and diameter (which       characterizes the maximal amount of water it can handle). For each house, there is at most one pipe going into it and at       most one pipe going out of it.

Each tank house will convey water to all houses that       have a sequence of pipes from the tank to it. Accordingly, each       tap house will receive water originating from some tank house. In order to avoid pipes from bursting one week later (like what       happened last semester), Lulu also has to consider the diameter of       the pipes.

132,"A lot of people associate Logo programming language with turtle       graphics. In this case the turtle moves along the straight line       and accepts commands ""T"" (""turn around"")       and ""F""       (""move 1 unit forward""). You are given a list of commands that will be given to the       turtle. You have to change exactly  n commands from the list (one command can be       changed several times). How far from the starting point can the       turtle move after it follows all the commands of the modified list?","The first line of input contains a string  commands — the original list of commands. The       string  commands contains between 1 and 100 characters,       inclusive, and contains only characters ""T"" and ""F"".

133,"INTERCAL is the oldest of esoteric programming languages. One of       its many weird features is the method of character-based output,       known as Turing Tape method. It converts an array of unsigned       8-bit integers into a sequence of characters to print, using the       following method. The integers of the array are processed one by one, starting from       the first. Processing  i-th element of the array is done in three steps: 1. The 8-bit binary notation of the ASCII-code of the previous       printed character is reversed. When the first element of the array       is processed, the result of this step is considered to be 0. 2. The  i-th element of the array is subtracted from the       result of the previous step modulo 256. 3. The binary notation of the result of the previous step is       reversed again to produce ASCII-code of the  i-th character to be printed. You are given the text printed using this method. Restore the       array used to produce this text.","The input will consist of a single line  text which contains the message printed using the       described method. String  text will contain between 1 and 100 characters,       inclusive. ASCII-code of each character of  text will be between 32 (space) and 126 (tilde), inclusive.","Output the initial array, which was used to produce  text, one integer per line.","Let's have a closer look at the beginning of the example. The       first character is ""H"" with ASCII-code 72 = 010010002. Its reverse is 000100102 = 18, and this number should       become the result of the second step of processing. The result of       the first step is considered to be 0, so the first element of the       array has to be (0 - 18) mod 256 = 238, where  a mod  b is the remainder of division of  a by  b."

Petya immediately offered Masha to play the game with him. Before the very beginning of the game several cards are lain out       on a table in one line from the left to the right. Each card       contains a digit: 0 or 1. Players move in turns and Masha moves       first. During each move a player should remove a card from the       table and shift all other cards so as to close the gap left by the       removed card. For example, if before somebody's move the cards on       the table formed a sequence 01010101, then after the fourth       card is removed (the cards are numbered starting from 1), the       sequence will look like that: 0100101.  The game ends when exactly two cards are left on the table. The       digits on these cards determine the number in binary notation: the       most significant bit is located to the left. Masha's aim is to       minimize the number and Petya's aim is to maximize it. An unpleasant accident occurred before the game started. The kids       spilled juice on some of the cards and the digits on the cards got       blurred. Each one of the spoiled cards could have either 0 or 1       written on it. Consider all possible variants of initial       arrangement of the digits (before the juice spilling). For each       variant, let's find which two cards are left by the end of the       game, assuming that both Petya and Masha play optimally.

138,"One day Natalia was walking in the woods when she met a little       mushroom gnome. The gnome told her the following story: Everybody knows that the mushroom gnomes' power lies in the magic       mushrooms that grow in the native woods of the gnomes. There are          n trees and  m magic mushrooms in the woods: the  i-th tree grows at a point on a straight line with       coordinates  a  i and has the height of  h  i, the  j-th mushroom grows at the point with coordinates          b  j and has magical powers  z  j. But one day wild mushroommunchers, the sworn enemies of mushroom       gnomes unleashed a terrible storm on their home forest. As a       result, some of the trees began to fall and crush the magic       mushrooms. The supreme oracle of mushroom gnomes calculated in       advance the probability for each tree that it will fall to the       left, to the right or will stand on. If the tree with the       coordinate  x and height  h falls to the left, then all the mushrooms that       belong to the right-open interval [x - h, x), are       destroyed. If a tree falls to the right, then the mushrooms that       belong to the left-open interval (x, x + h] are       destroyed. Only those mushrooms that are not hit by a single tree survive. Knowing that all the trees fall independently of each other       (i.e., all the events are mutually independent, and besides, the       trees do not interfere with other trees falling in an arbitrary       direction), the supreme oracle was also able to quickly calculate       what would be the expectation of the total power of the mushrooms       which survived after the storm. His calculations ultimately saved       the mushroom gnomes from imminent death. Natalia, as a good Olympiad programmer, got interested in this       story, and she decided to come up with a way to quickly calculate       the expectation of the sum of the surviving mushrooms' power.","The first line contains two integers  n and  m (1 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 104) — the number of trees and       mushrooms, respectively.

139,"Vera adores poems. All the poems Vera knows are divided into       quatrains (groups of four lines) and in each quatrain some lines       contain rhymes. Let's consider that all lines in the poems consist of lowercase       Latin letters (without spaces). Letters ""a"", ""e"", ""i"", ""o"", ""u"" are considered vowels. Two lines rhyme if their suffixes that start from the  k-th vowels (counting from the end) match. If a       line has less than  k vowels, then such line can't rhyme with any       other line. For example, if  k = 1, lines  commit and  hermit rhyme (the corresponding suffixes equal          it), and if  k = 2, they do not rhyme ( ommit ≠ ermit). Today on a literature lesson Vera learned that quatrains can       contain four different schemes of rhymes, namely the following       ones (the same letters stand for rhyming lines):  If all lines of a quatrain pairwise rhyme, then the quatrain can       belong to any rhyme scheme (this situation is represented by  aaaa). If all quatrains of a poem belong to the same rhyme scheme, then       we can assume that the whole poem belongs to this rhyme scheme. If       in each quatrain all lines pairwise rhyme, then the rhyme scheme       of the poem is  aaaa. Let us note that it doesn't matter whether       lines from different quatrains rhyme with each other or not. In       other words, it is possible that different quatrains aren't       connected by a rhyme. Vera got a long poem as a home task. The girl has to analyse it       and find the poem rhyme scheme. Help Vera cope with the task.","The first line contains two integers  n and  k (1 ≤ n ≤ 2500, 1 ≤ k ≤ 5) — the number of       quatrains in the poem and the vowel's number, correspondingly.       Next 4n lines contain the       poem. Each line is not empty and only consists of small Latin       letters. The total length of the lines does not exceed 104. If we assume that the lines are numbered starting from 1, then       the first quatrain contains lines number 1, 2, 3, 4; the       second one contains lines number 5,         6, 7, 8; and so on.","Print the rhyme scheme of the poem as ""aabb"", ""abab"", ""abba"", ""aaaa""; or ""NO"" if the poem does not       belong to any of the above mentioned schemes.","In the last sample both quatrains have rhymes but finding the       common scheme is impossible, so the answer is ""NO""."

As Sam was a       bright farmer, he tried to make the process of storing hay simpler       and more convenient to use. He collected the hay into cubical hay       blocks of the same size. Then he stored the blocks in his barn.       After a summer spent in hard toil Sam stored  A·B·C hay blocks and stored them in       a barn as a rectangular parallelepiped  A layers high.

145," Petya loves lucky numbers         very much. Everybody knows that lucky numbers are positive         integers whose decimal record contains only the lucky digits           4 and 7. For example, numbers 47, 744, 4 are lucky and 5, 17, 467 are not. Petya has sequence  a consisting of  n integers. The subsequence of the sequence  a is such subsequence that can be obtained from          a by removing zero or more of its elements. Two sequences are considered different if index sets of numbers       included in them are different. That is, the values ​of the       elements ​do not matter in the comparison of subsequences. In       particular, any sequence of length  n has exactly 2 n different subsequences (including an       empty subsequence). A subsequence is considered lucky if it has a length exactly          k and does not contain two identical lucky numbers       (unlucky numbers can be repeated any number of times). Help Petya find the number of different lucky subsequences of the       sequence  a.

158,"Vasya is writing an operating system shell, and it should have       commands for working with directories. To begin with, he decided       to go with just two commands: cd (change the current directory)       and pwd (display the       current directory). Directories in Vasya's operating system form a traditional       hierarchical tree structure. There is a single root directory,       denoted by the slash character ""/"". Every other directory       has a name — a non-empty string consisting of lowercase Latin       letters. Each directory (except for the root) has a parent       directory — the one that contains the given directory. It is       denoted as "".."". The command cd takes a       single parameter, which is a path in the file system. The command       changes the current directory to the directory specified by the       path. The path consists of the names of directories separated by       slashes. The name of the directory can be "".."", which means a step up       to the parent directory. «..» can be used in any place of       the path, maybe several times. If the path begins with a slash, it       is considered to be an absolute path, that is, the directory       changes to the specified one, starting from the root. If the       parameter begins with a directory name (or ""..""), it is considered to be       a relative path, that is, the directory changes to the specified       directory, starting from the current one. The command pwd should       display the absolute path to the current directory. This path must       not contain "".."". Initially, the current directory is the root. All directories       mentioned explicitly or passed indirectly within any command cd are considered to exist. It is       guaranteed that there is no attempt of transition to the parent       directory of the root directory.","The first line of the input data contains the single integer          n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) — the number of commands. Then follow  n lines, each contains one command. Each of these       lines contains either command pwd, or command cd, followed by a space-separated       non-empty parameter. The command parameter cd       only contains lower case Latin letters, slashes and dots, two       slashes cannot go consecutively, dots occur only as the name of a       parent pseudo-directory. The command parameter cd does not end with a slash,       except when it is the only symbol that points to the root       directory. The command parameter has a length from 1 to 200       characters, inclusive. Directories in the file system can have the same names.","For each command pwd you       should print the full absolute path of the given directory, ending       with a slash.

161,"Polycarpus analyzes a string called abracadabra. This string is       constructed using the following algorithm:  Let's have a closer look at the algorithm. On the second step       Polycarpus will concatenate two strings ""a"" and insert the character         ""b"" between       them, resulting in ""aba"" string. The third step       will transform it into ""abacaba"", and the fourth one       - into ""abacabadabacaba"". Thus, the       string constructed on the  k-th step will consist of 2 k - 1 characters.  Polycarpus wrote down the string he got after 30 steps of the       given algorithm and chose two non-empty substrings of it.

163,"Anton came to a chocolate factory. There he found a working       conveyor and decided to run on it from the beginning to the end. The conveyor is a looped belt with a total length of 2l meters, of which  l meters are located on the surface and are       arranged in a straight line. The part of the belt which turns at       any moment (the part which emerges from under the floor to the       surface and returns from the surface under the floor) is assumed       to be negligibly short. The belt is moving uniformly at speed  v 1 meters per second. Anton       will be moving on it in the same direction at the constant speed       of  v 2 meters per second, so       his speed relatively to the floor will be  v 1 + v 2 meters per second. Anton       will neither stop nor change the speed or the direction of movement. Here and there there are chocolates stuck to the belt ( n chocolates).

If a chocolate is at the       beginning of the belt at the moment when Anton starts running, he       will take it, and if a chocolate is at the end of the belt at the       moment when Anton comes off the belt, he will leave it.

We know for the  i-th trolleybus that it leaves at the moment of       time  t  i seconds, can go at a speed of no greater       than  v  i meters per second, and accelerate with       an acceleration no greater than  a meters per second squared.

169,"One day Polycarpus got hold of two non-empty strings  s and  t, consisting of lowercase Latin letters.

Two pairs are considered different,       if they contain different substrings of string  s or different subsequences of string  t. Read the whole statement to understand the       definition of different substrings and subsequences. The length of string  s is the number of characters in it. If we denote       the length of the string  s as |s|, we       can write the string as  s = s 1 s 2... s |s|.

170,"One day Polycarpus got hold of two non-empty strings  s and  t, consisting of lowercase Latin letters.       Polycarpus is quite good with strings, so he immediately wondered,       how many different pairs of "" x  y"" are there, such that  x is a substring of string  s,  y is a subsequence of string  t, and the content of  x and  y is the same. Two pairs are considered different,       if they contain different substrings of string  s or different subsequences of string  t. Read the whole statement to understand the       definition of different substrings and subsequences. The length of string  s is the number of characters in it. If we denote       the length of the string  s as |s|, we       can write the string as  s = s 1 s 2... s |s|. A substring of  s is a non-empty string  x = s[a... b] = s  a s  a + 1... s  b (1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ |s|).

172,"There is a bus stop near the university. The lessons are over,       and  n students come to the stop. The  i-th student will appear at the bus stop at time          t  i (all  t  i's are distinct). We shall assume that the stop is located on the coordinate axis          Ox, at point  x = 0, and the bus goes along the ray  Ox, that is, towards the positive direction of the       coordinate axis, and back. The  i-th student needs to get to the point with       coordinate  x  i ( x  i > 0). The bus moves by the following algorithm. Initially it is at       point 0. The students consistently come to the stop and get on it.       The bus has a seating capacity which is equal to  m passengers. At the moment when  m students get on the bus, it starts moving in the       positive direction of the coordinate axis. Also it starts moving       when the last ( n-th) student gets on the bus. The bus is moving       at a speed of 1 unit of distance per 1 unit of time, i.e. it       covers distance  y in time  y. Every time the bus passes the point at which at least one student       needs to get off, it stops and these students get off the bus. The       students need 1 + [k / 2]       units of time to get off the bus, where  k is the number of students who leave at this       point. Expression [k / 2]       denotes rounded down  k / 2. As soon as the last student leaves the bus,       the bus turns around and goes back to the point  x = 0. It doesn't make any stops until it reaches       the point. At the given point the bus fills with students once       more, and everything is repeated. If students come to the stop when there's no bus, they form a       line (queue) and get on the bus in the order in which they came.       Any number of students get on the bus in negligible time, you       should assume that it doesn't take any time. Any other actions       also take no time. The bus has no other passengers apart from the students. Write a program that will determine for each student the time       when he got off the bus. The moment a student got off the bus is       the moment the bus stopped at the student's destination stop       (despite the fact that the group of students need some time to get off).","The first line contains two space-separated integers  n, m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 105) — the number of students and       the number of passengers the bus can transport, correspondingly.

So the student leaves the bus at the moment of time 3 + 5 = 8. In the second sample the capacity of the bus equals 1, that's why it will drive the first       student alone. This student is the same as the student from the       first sample. So the bus arrives to his destination at the moment       of time 8, spends 1 + [1 / 2] = 1 units of time on getting       him off, and returns back to 0 in       additional 5 units of time. That is,       the bus returns to the bus stop at the moment of time 14. By this moment the second student has       already came to the bus stop. So he immediately gets in the bus,       and is driven to his destination in additional 5 units of time. He gets there at the       moment 14 + 5 = 19.  In the third sample the bus waits for the fourth student for         6 units of time, then drives for         5 units of time, then gets the       passengers off for 1 + [4 / 2] = 3       units of time, then returns for 5       units of time, and then drives the fifth student for 1 unit of time."

185,"The Fat Rat and his friend Сerealguy have had a bet whether at       least a few oats are going to descend to them by some clever       construction. The figure below shows the clever construction. A more formal description of the clever construction is as       follows. The clever construction consists of  n rows with scales. The first row has  n scales, the second row has (n - 1) scales, the  i-th row has (n - i + 1) scales, the last       row has exactly one scale. Let's number the scales in each row       from the left to the right, starting from 1. Then the value of  w  i, k in kilograms (1 ≤ i ≤ n; 1 ≤ k ≤ n - i + 1)       is the weight capacity parameter of the  k-th scale in the  i-th row.  If a body whose mass is not less than  w  i, k falls on the scale with weight       capacity  w  i, k, then the scale breaks. At       that anything that the scale has on it, either falls one level       down to the left (if possible) or one level down to the right (if       possible). In other words, if the scale  w  i, k (i < n) breaks, then       there are at most two possible variants in which the contents of       the scale's pan can fall out: all       contents of scale  w  i, k falls either on scale  w  i + 1, k - 1 (if it exists), or on       scale  w  i + 1, k (if it exists). If scale          w  n, 1 breaks, then all its contents falls       right in the Fat Rat's claws. Please note that the scales that are       the first and the last in a row, have only one variant of dropping       the contents. Initially, oats are simultaneously put on all scales of the first       level. The  i-th scale has  a  i kilograms of oats put on it. After that       the scales start breaking and the oats start falling down in some       way. You can consider everything to happen instantly. That is, the       scale breaks instantly and the oats also fall instantly. The Fat Rat is sure that whatever happens, he will not get the       oats from the first level.

After team       excursion to Sun Island Park for snow sculpture art exposition,       PMP should get back to buses before they leave. But the park is       really big and he does not know how to find them. The park has  n intersections numbered 1 through  n. There are  m bidirectional roads that connect some pairs of       these intersections. At  k intersections, ICPC volunteers are helping the       teams and showing them the way to their destinations. Locations of       volunteers are fixed and distinct. When PMP asks a volunteer the way to bus station, he/she can tell       him the whole path. But the park is fully covered with ice and       snow and everywhere looks almost the same.

He always tells       volunteers about his weak memory and if there is no direct path of       length (in number of roads) at most  q that leads to bus station, the volunteer will       guide PMP to another volunteer (who is at most  q intersections away, of course). ICPC volunteers       know the area very well and always tell PMP the best way. So if       there exists a way to bus stations, PMP will definitely find it.

190,"Vasya used to be an accountant before the war began and he is one       of the few who knows how to operate a computer, so he was assigned       as the programmer. We all know that programs often store sets of integers.

So, as Vasya was trying to represent characteristics of a       recently invented robot in his program, he faced the following problem. Vasya is not a programmer, so he asked his friend Gena, what the       convenient way to store  n integers is. Gena used to code in language         X-- and so he can use       only the types that occur in this language. Let's define, what a       ""type"" is in language X--: More formally: type :=         int | pair<type,type>. For       example, Gena uses the following type for graph edges: pair<int,pair<int,int>>. Gena was pleased to help Vasya, he dictated to Vasya a type of       language X--, that stores          n integers. Unfortunately, Gena was in a hurry, so       he omitted the punctuation. Now Gena has already left and Vasya       can't find the correct punctuation, resulting in a type of       language X--, however hard       he tries. Help Vasya and add the punctuation marks so as to receive the       valid type of language X--.

192,"The ancient Berlanders believed that the longer the name, the       more important its bearer is. Thus, Berland kings were famous for       their long names. But long names are somewhat inconvenient, so the       Berlanders started to abbreviate the names of their kings. They       called every king by the first letters of its name. Thus, the       king, whose name was Victorious Vasily Pupkin, was always called       by the berlanders VVP. In Berland over its long history many dynasties of kings replaced       each other, but they were all united by common traditions. Thus,       according to one Berland traditions, to maintain stability in the       country, the first name of the heir should be the same as the last       name his predecessor (hence, the first letter of the abbreviated       name of the heir coincides with the last letter of the abbreviated       name of the predecessor). Berlanders appreciate stability, so this       tradition has never been broken. Also Berlanders like perfection,       so another tradition requires that the first name of the first       king in the dynasty coincides with the last name of the last king       in this dynasty (hence, the first letter of the abbreviated name       of the first king coincides with the last letter of the       abbreviated name of the last king). This tradition, of course, has       also been always observed. The name of a dynasty is formed by very simple rules: we take all       the short names of the kings in the order in which they ruled, and       write them in one line. Thus, a dynasty of kings ""ab""       and ""ba"" is called ""abba"", and the dynasty,       which had only the king ""abca"", is called ""abca"".

195,"Vasya is developing his own programming language VPL (Vasya       Programming Language). Right now he is busy making the system of       exceptions. He thinks that the system of exceptions must function       like that. The exceptions are processed by try-catch-blocks. There are two       operators that work with the blocks: The exceptions can occur in the program in only one case: when we       use the throw operator. The         throw(<exception_type>)       operator creates the exception of the given type. Let's suggest that as a result of using some throw operator the program       created an exception of type  a. In this case a try-catch-block is activated,       such that this block's try       operator was described in the program earlier than the used throw operator. Also, this       block's catch operator was       given an exception type  a as a parameter and this block's catch operator is described later       that the used throw       operator.

Next  n lines contain the program in language VPL. Each       line contains no more than one operator. It means that input file       can contain empty lines and lines, consisting only of spaces. The program contains only operators try, catch and throw. It is guaranteed that the       program is correct. It means that each started try-catch-block was       closed, the catch operators       aren't used unless there is an open try-catch-block. The program       has exactly one throw       operator. The program may have spaces at the beginning of a line,       at the end of a line, before and after a bracket, a comma or a       quote mark.

216,"A new Berland businessman Vitaly is going to open a household       appliances' store. All he's got to do now is to hire the staff. The store will work seven days a week, but not around the clock.       Every day at least  k people must work in the store. Berland has a law that determines the order of working days and       non-working days. Namely, each employee must work for exactly          n consecutive days, then rest for exactly  m days, then work for  n more days and rest for  m more, and so on. Vitaly doesn't want to break       the law. Fortunately, there is a loophole: the law comes into       force on the day when the employee is hired. For example, if an       employee is hired on day  x, then he should work on days [x, x + 1, ..., x + n - 1],         [x + m + n, x + m + n + 1, ..., x + m + 2n - 1],       and so on. Day  x can be chosen arbitrarily by Vitaly. There is one more thing: the key to the store. Berland law       prohibits making copies of keys, so there is only one key. Vitaly       is planning to entrust the key to the store employees. At the same       time on each day the key must be with an employee who works that       day — otherwise on this day no one can get inside the store.       During the day the key holder can give the key to another       employee, if he also works that day. The key will handed to the       first hired employee at his first working day. Each employee has to be paid salary. Therefore, Vitaly wants to       hire as few employees as possible provided that the store can       operate normally on each day from 1       to infinity.

217,"The Bytelandian Institute for Biological Research (BIBR) is       investigating the properties of two species of bacteria, named       simply 0 and 1. Even under a microscope, bacteria of those two       species are very difficult to distinguish. In fact, the only thing       the scientists possess that is able to differentiate between them       is a plant called Formurosa. If the scientists place a sample of colonies of bacteria on each       on Formurosa's leaves, it will activate a complicated nutrition       process. During that process color of Formurosa changes to reflect       the result of a — possibly very complicated — logical formula on       the species of bacteria, involving constants and the operators         | (OR), & (AND) and ^ (XOR). If it is 0, the plant will turn       red, otherwise — it will turn blue. For example, if the nutrition process of Formurosa is described       by the formula: (((?^?)|?)&(1^?)); then Formurosa has       four leaves (the ""?"" signs denote the leaves).       If we place 0, 1, 0, 0 on the       respective leaves, the result of the nutrition process will be         (((0^1)|0)&(1^0)) = 1,       therefore the plant will turn blue.

227,"An expedition group flew from planet ACM-1 to Earth in order to       study the bipedal species (its representatives don't even have       antennas on their heads!). The flying saucer, on which the brave pioneers set off, consists       of three sections. These sections are connected by a chain: the       1-st section is adjacent only to the 2-nd one, the 2-nd one — to       the 1-st and the 3-rd ones, the 3-rd one — only to the 2-nd one.       The transitions are possible only between the adjacent sections. The spacecraft team consists of  n aliens. Each of them is given a rank — an       integer from 1 to  n. The ranks of all astronauts are distinct. The       rules established on the Saucer, state that an alien may move from       section  a to section  b only if it is senior in rank to all aliens who       are in the segments  a and  b (besides, the segments  a and  b are of course required to be adjacent). Any       alien requires exactly 1 minute to       make a move. Besides, safety regulations require that no more than       one alien moved at the same minute along the ship. Alien  A is senior in rank to alien  B, if the number indicating rank  A, is more than the corresponding number for  B. At the moment the whole saucer team is in the 3-rd segment. They       all need to move to the 1-st segment.

Then he       takes a clean square sheet of paper and paints a fractal by the       following algorithm: In each of the following steps step 2 repeats.

He came to a very complex practice system.       Each practice consists of one game, all  n players of the team take part in the game. The       players are sorted into two teams in some way. In this case, the       teams may have different numbers of players, but each team must       have at least one player. The coach wants to be sure that after the series of the practice       sessions each pair of players had at least one practice, when they       played in different teams. As the players' energy is limited, the       coach wants to achieve the goal in the least number of practices. Help him to schedule the practices.",A single input line contains integer  n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1000).,"In the first line print  m — the minimum number of practices the coach will       have to schedule.

241,"Mirror Box is a name of a popular game in the Iranian National       Amusement Park (INAP). There is a wooden box, 105 cm       long and 100 cm high in this game.       Some parts of the box's ceiling and floor are covered by mirrors.       There are two negligibly small holes in the opposite sides of the       box at heights  h  l and  h  r centimeters above the floor. The picture       below shows what the box looks like. In the game, you will be given a laser gun to shoot once. The       laser beam must enter from one hole and exit from the other one.       Each mirror has a preset number  v  i, which shows the number of points       players gain if their laser beam hits that mirror. Also — to make       things even funnier — the beam must not hit any mirror more than once. Given the information about the box, your task is to find the       maximum score a player may gain. Please note that the reflection       obeys the law ""the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection"".","The first line of the input contains three space-separated       integers  h  l, h  r, n (0 < h  l, h  r < 100, 0 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the heights of the       holes and the number of the mirrors.

No two mirrors will share a common point. Consider that the  x coordinate increases in the direction from left       to right, so the border with the hole at height  h  l has the  x coordinate equal to 0 and the border with the       hole at height  h  r has the  x coordinate equal to 105.",The only line of output should contain a single integer — the       maximum possible score a player could gain.,"The second sample is depicted above.

The red beam on the picture given         in the statement shows how the laser beam can go approximately,         this is just illustration how the laser beam can gain score. So         for the second sample there is no such beam that gain score 110."

248,"It's a beautiful April day and Wallace is playing football with       his friends. But his friends do not know that Wallace actually       stayed home with Gromit and sent them his robotic self instead.       Robo-Wallace has several advantages over the other guys. For       example, he can hit the ball directly to the specified point. And       yet, the notion of a giveaway is foreign to him. The combination       of these features makes the Robo-Wallace the perfect footballer —       as soon as the ball gets to him, he can just aim and hit the goal.       He followed this tactics in the first half of the match, but he       hit the goal rarely. The opposing team has a very good goalkeeper       who catches most of the balls that fly directly into the goal. But       Robo-Wallace is a quick thinker, he realized that he can cheat the       goalkeeper. After all, they are playing in a football box with       solid walls. Robo-Wallace can kick the ball to the other side,       then the goalkeeper will not try to catch the ball. Then, if the       ball bounces off the wall and flies into the goal, the goal will       at last be scored. Your task is to help Robo-Wallace to detect a spot on the wall of       the football box, to which the robot should kick the ball, so that       the ball bounces once and only once off this wall and goes       straight to the goal. In the first half of the match Robo-Wallace       got a ball in the head and was severely hit. As a result, some of       the schemes have been damaged. Because of the damage, Robo-Wallace       can only aim to his right wall (Robo-Wallace is standing with his       face to the opposing team's goal). The football box is rectangular. Let's introduce a       two-dimensional coordinate system so that point (0, 0) lies       in the lower left corner of the field, if you look at the box       above. Robo-Wallace is playing for the team, whose goal is to the       right. It is an improvised football field, so the gate of       Robo-Wallace's rivals may be not in the middle of the left wall. In the given coordinate system you are given:  A goal is scored when the center of the ball crosses the  OY axis in the given coordinate system between         (0,  y 1) and (0,  y 2). The ball moves along a       straight line. The ball's hit on the wall is perfectly elastic       (the ball does not shrink from the hit), the angle of incidence       equals the angle of reflection. If the ball bounces off the wall       not to the goal, that is, if it hits the other wall or the goal       post, then the opposing team catches the ball and Robo-Wallace       starts looking for miscalculation and gets dysfunctional.

253,"Vasya is pressing the keys on the keyboard reluctantly, squeezing       out his ideas on the classical epos depicted in Homer's       Odysseus... How can he explain to his literature teacher that he       isn't going to become a writer? In fact, he is going to become a       programmer. So, he would take great pleasure in writing a program,       but none — in writing a composition. As Vasya was fishing for a sentence in the dark pond of his       imagination, he suddenly wondered: what is the least number of       times he should push a key to shift the cursor from one position       to another one? Let's describe his question more formally: to type a text, Vasya       is using the text editor. He has already written  n lines, the  i-th line contains  a  i characters (including spaces). If some       line contains  k characters, then this line overall contains         (k + 1) positions where the       cursor can stand: before some character or after all characters       (at the end of the line). Thus, the cursor's position is       determined by a pair of integers (r, c), where  r is the number of the line and  c is the cursor's position in the line (the       positions are indexed starting from one from the beginning of the line). Vasya doesn't use the mouse to move the cursor. He uses keys       ""Up"", ""Down"", ""Right"" and       ""Left"". When he pushes each of these keys, the cursor       shifts in the needed direction. Let's assume that before the       corresponding key is pressed, the cursor was located in the       position (r, c), then       Vasya pushed key: You've got the number of lines in the text file and the number of       characters, written in each line of this file.

282,"The Bitlandians are quite weird people. They do everything       differently. They have a different alphabet so they have a       different definition for a string. A Bitlandish string is a string made only of characters         ""0"" and         ""1"". BitHaval (the mayor of Bitland) loves to play with Bitlandish       strings. He takes some Bitlandish string  a, and applies several (possibly zero) operations       to it. In one operation the mayor may take any two adjacent       characters of a string, define one of them as  x and the other one as  y. Then he calculates two values  p and  q:  p = x xor y,  q = x or y. Then he replaces       one of the two taken characters by  p and the other one by  q. The  xor operation means the bitwise excluding OR       operation. The  or operation is the bitwise OR operation. So for example one operation can transform string 11 to string 10 or to string 01. String 1 cannot be transformed into any       other string. You've got two Bitlandish strings  a and  b.

The shamans of Ultima Thule have been       using lots of different types of brackets since prehistoric times.       A bracket type is a positive integer. The shamans define a correct       bracket sequence as follows: For example, sequences {1, 1,  - 1, 2,  - 2,  - 1} and {3,  - 3} are correct bracket sequences,       and {2,  - 3} is not.

291," The problem uses a simplified         TCP/IP address model, please make sure you've read the statement attentively. Polycarpus has found a job, he is a system administrator. One day       he came across  n IP addresses. Each IP address is a 32 bit       number, represented as a group of four 8-bit numbers (without       leading zeroes), separated by dots. For example, the record 0.255.1.123 shows a correct IP       address and records 0.256.1.123 and 0.255.1.01 do not. In this       problem an arbitrary group of four 8-bit numbers is a correct IP address. Having worked as an administrator for some time, Polycarpus       learned that if you know the IP address, you can use the subnet       mask to get the address of the network that has this IP addess. The subnet mask is an IP       address that has the following property: if we write this IP       address as a 32 bit string, that it is representable as         ""11...11000..000"". In other       words, the subnet mask first has one or more one bits, and then       one or more zero bits (overall there are 32 bits). For example,       the IP address 2.0.0.0 is       not a correct subnet mask as its 32-bit record looks as 00000010000000000000000000000000. To get the network address of the IP address, you need to perform       the operation of the bitwise ""and"" of the IP address and       the subnet mask. For example, if the subnet mask is 255.192.0.0, and the IP address       is 192.168.1.2, then the       network address equals 192.128.0.0. In the bitwise       ""and"" the result has a bit that equals 1 if and only if       both operands have corresponding bits equal to one. Now Polycarpus wants to find all networks to which his IP       addresses belong. Unfortunately, Polycarpus lost subnet mask.       Fortunately, Polycarpus remembers that his IP addresses belonged       to exactly  k distinct networks. Help Polycarpus find the       subnet mask, such that his IP addresses will belong to exactly          k distinct networks.

Since you are       good friends with Alice and Bob, you decide to split the array in       two. Precisely, you need to construct two arrays  a and  b that are also of length  n, with the following conditions for all  i (1 ≤ i ≤ n): Ideally,  a and  b should also be unique arrays. However, life in       the Arctic is hard and this is not always possible. Fortunately,       Alice and Bob are still happy if their arrays are almost unique.

For example, the array [1, 2, 1, 3, 2] is almost unique because       after removing the first two entries, it becomes [1, 3, 2]. The array [1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2] is not almost unique       because we need to remove at least 3       entries to turn it into a unique array.

It is allowed to       purify a cell more than once. You would like to purify all  n × n cells while minimizing the number of       times you cast the ""Purification"" spell. This sounds       very easy, but you just noticed that some tiles are particularly       more evil than the other tiles. You cannot cast the       ""Purification"" spell on those particularly more evil       tiles, not even after they have been purified. They can still be       purified if a cell sharing the same row or the same column gets       selected by the ""Purification"" spell.

332,"A student's life is fraught with complications. Some Berland       University students know this only too well. Having studied for       two years, they contracted strong antipathy towards the       chairperson of some department. Indeed, the person in question       wasn't the kindest of ladies to begin with: prone to reforming       groups, banning automatic passes and other mean deeds. At last the       students decided that she just can't get away with all this anymore... The students pulled some strings on the higher levels and learned       that the next University directors' meeting is going to discuss          n orders about the chairperson and accept exactly          p of them. There are two values assigned to each       order:  a  i is the number of the chairperson's hairs       that turn grey if she obeys the order and  b  i — the displeasement of the directors if       the order isn't obeyed. The students may make the directors pass       any  p orders chosen by them. The students know that       the chairperson will obey exactly  k out of these  p orders. She will pick the orders to obey in the       way that minimizes first, the directors' displeasement and second,       the number of hairs on her head that turn grey. The students want to choose  p orders in the way that maximizes the number of       hairs on the chairperson's head that turn grey. If there are       multiple ways to accept the orders, then the students are keen on       maximizing the directors' displeasement with the chairperson's       actions. Help them.","The first line contains three integers  n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105),  p (1 ≤ p ≤ n),  k (1 ≤ k ≤ p) — the number of       orders the directors are going to discuss, the number of orders to       pass and the number of orders to be obeyed by the chairperson,       correspondingly. Each of the following  n lines contains two integers  a  i and  b  i (1 ≤ a  i, b  i ≤ 109),       describing the corresponding order.","Print in an arbitrary       order  p distinct integers — the numbers of the orders to       accept so that the students could carry out the revenge.

Note that the same result can be       achieved with order 4 instead of order 3. In the second sample, the chairperson can obey all the orders, so       the best strategy for the students is to pick the orders with the       maximum sum of  a  i values. The chairperson gets 58 new gray       hairs and the directors' displeasement will equal 0."
333,"Gerald has a friend, Pollard. Pollard is interested in lucky       tickets (ticket is a sequence of digits). At first he thought that       a ticket is lucky if between some its digits we can add arithmetic       signs and brackets so that the result obtained by the arithmetic       expression was number 100. But he quickly analyzed all such       tickets and moved on to a more general question. Now he explores          k-lucky tickets. Pollard sais that a ticket is  k-lucky if we can add arithmetic operation signs       between its digits to the left or right of them (i.e.,       ""+"", ""-"", "" × "") and brackets so as to obtain       the correct arithmetic expression whose value would equal  k. For example, ticket ""224201016"" is       1000-lucky as ( - 2 - (2 + 4)) × (2 + 0) + 1016 = 1000. Pollard was so carried away by the lucky tickets that he signed       up for a seminar on lucky tickets and, as far as Gerald knows,       Pollard will attend it daily at 7 pm in some famous institute and       will commute to it in the same tram for  m days. In this tram tickets have eight digits.       And Gerald wants to make a surprise for Pollard: each day Pollard       will receive a tram  k-lucky ticket. The conductor has already agreed       to give Pollard certain tickets during all these  m days and he only wants Gerald to tell him what       kind of tickets to give out.

335,"In a far away land, there are two cities near a river. One day,       the cities decide that they have too little space and would like       to reclaim some of the river area into land. The river area can be represented by a grid with  r rows and exactly two columns — each cell       represents a rectangular area. The rows are numbered 1 through  r from top to bottom, while the columns are       numbered 1 and 2. Initially, all of the cells are occupied by the river. The plan       is to turn some of those cells into land one by one, with the       cities alternately choosing a cell to reclaim, and continuing       until no more cells can be reclaimed. However, the river is also used as a major trade route. The       cities need to make sure that ships will still be able to sail       from one end of the river to the other. More formally, if a cell         (r, c) has been       reclaimed, it is not allowed to reclaim any of the cells (r - 1, 3 - c), (r, 3 - c), or (r + 1, 3 - c).

In large electronic sports competitions where       Kostya's team is going to participate, the matches are held in the       Captains Mode. In this mode the captains select the heroes by       making one of two possible actions in a certain, predetermined       order: pick or ban. The team captain may miss a pick or a ban. If he misses a pick, a       random hero is added to his team from those that were available at       that moment, and if he misses a ban, no hero is banned, as if       there was no ban. Kostya has already identified the strength of all the heroes       based on the new patch fixes. Of course, Kostya knows the order of       picks and bans. The strength of a team is the sum of the strengths       of the team's heroes and both teams that participate in the match       seek to maximize the difference in strengths in their favor.

When playing       two on two, one player of each team controls the goalkeeper and       the full-backs (plays defence), the other player controls the       half-backs and forwards (plays attack). Two teams of company Q decided to battle each other. Let's       enumerate players from both teams by integers from 1 to 4. The       first and second player play in the first team, the third and the       fourth one play in the second team. For each of the four players       we know their game skills in defence and attack. The defence skill       of the  i-th player is  a  i, the attack skill is  b  i. Before the game, the teams determine how they will play. First       the players of the first team decide who will play in the attack,       and who will play in the defence. Then the second team players do       the same, based on the choice of their opponents. We will define a team's defence as the defence skill of player of       the team who plays defence. Similarly, a team's attack is the       attack skill of the player of the team who plays attack. We assume       that one team is guaranteed to beat the other one, if its defence       is strictly greater than the opponent's attack and its attack is       strictly greater than the opponent's defence. The teams of company Q know each other's strengths and therefore       arrange their teams optimally. Identify the team that is       guaranteed to win (if both teams act optimally) or tell that there       is no such team.","The input contain the players' description in four lines. The          i-th line contains two space-separated integers          a  i and  b  i (1 ≤ a  i, b  i ≤ 100) — the defence and the attack       skill of the  i-th player, correspondingly.","If the first team can win, print phrase ""Team 1"" (without the       quotes), if the second team can win, print phrase ""Team 2"" (without the       quotes). If no of the teams can definitely win, print ""Draw"" (without the quotes).","Let consider the first test sample. The first team can definitely       win if it will choose the following arrangement: the first player       plays attack, the second player plays defence. Consider the second sample. The order of the choosing roles for       players makes sense in this sample. As the members of the first       team choose first, the members of the second team can beat them       (because they know the exact defence value and attack value of the       first team)."
412,"Developers often face with regular expression patterns. A pattern       is usually defined as a string consisting of characters and       metacharacters that sets the rules for your search. These patterns       are most often used to check whether a particular string meets the       certain rules. In this task, a pattern will be a string consisting of small       English letters and question marks ('?'). The question mark in the       pattern is a metacharacter that denotes an arbitrary small letter       of the English alphabet. We will assume that a string matches the       pattern if we can transform the string into the pattern by       replacing the question marks by the appropriate characters. For       example, string aba matches       patterns: ???, ??a, a?a, aba. Programmers that work for the R1 company love puzzling each other       (and themselves) with riddles. One of them is as follows: you are       given  n patterns of the same length, you need to find a       pattern that contains as few question marks as possible, and       intersects with each of the given patterns. Two patterns intersect       if there is a string that matches both the first and the second       pattern. Can you solve this riddle?",The first line contains a single integer  n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of patterns. Next          n lines contain the patterns. It is guaranteed that the patterns can only consist of small       English letters and symbols '?'. All patterns are non-empty       and have the same length. The total length of all the patterns       does not exceed 105 characters.,"In a single line print the answer to the problem — the pattern       with the minimal number of signs '?', which intersects with each of       the given ones. If there are several answers, print any of them.","Consider the first example. Pattern xab intersects with each of the       given patterns. Pattern ???       also intersects with each of the given patterns, but it contains       more question signs, hence it is not an optimal answer. Clearly,         xab is the optimal       answer, because it doesn't contain any question sign. There are a       lot of other optimal answers, for example: aab, bab, cab, dab and so on."
413,"'Jeopardy!' is an intellectual game where players answer       questions and earn points. Company Q conducts a simplified       'Jeopardy!' tournament among the best IT companies. By a lucky       coincidence, the old rivals made it to the finals: company R1 and       company R2.  The finals will have  n questions,  m of them are auction questions and  n - m of them are regular questions. Each       question has a price. The price of the  i-th question is  a  i points. During the game the players       chose the questions. At that, if the question is an auction, then       the player who chose it can change the price if the number of his       current points is strictly larger than the price of the question.       The new price of the question cannot be less than the original       price and cannot be greater than the current number of points of       the player who chose the question. The correct answer brings the       player the points equal to the price of the question. The wrong       answer to the question reduces the number of the player's points       by the value of the question price. The game will go as follows. First, the R2 company selects a       question, then the questions are chosen by the one who answered       the previous question correctly. If no one answered the question,       then the person who chose last chooses again. All R2 employees support their team. They want to calculate what       maximum possible number of points the R2 team can get if luck is       on their side during the whole game (they will always be the first       to correctly answer questions). Perhaps you are not going to be       surprised, but this problem was again entrusted for you to solve.","The first line contains two space-separated integers  n and  m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100; m ≤ min(n, 30))       — the total number of questions and the number of auction       questions, correspondingly.

486,"Nam is playing with a string on his computer. The string consists       of  n lowercase English letters. It is meaningless, so       Nam decided to make the string more beautiful, that is to make it       be a palindrome by using 4 arrow keys: left, right, up, down. There is a cursor pointing at some symbol of the string. Suppose       that cursor is at position  i (1 ≤ i ≤ n, the string uses       1-based indexing) now. Left and right arrow keys are used to move       cursor around the string. The string is cyclic, that means that       when Nam presses left arrow key, the cursor will move to position          i - 1 if  i > 1 or to the end of the string (i. e.       position  n) otherwise. The same holds when he presses the       right arrow key (if  i = n, the cursor appears at the beginning       of the string). When Nam presses up arrow key, the letter which the text cursor       is pointing to will change to the next letter in English alphabet       (assuming that alphabet is also cyclic, i. e. after 'z' follows 'a'). The same holds when he       presses the down arrow key. Initially, the text cursor is at position  p.  Because Nam has a lot homework to do, he wants to complete this       as fast as possible.

What is the minimum number of candles Anya should use so that       during each visit, at least  r candles are burning? Anya can start to light a       candle at any time that is integer number of seconds from       midnight, possibly, at the time before midnight.

513,"Nowadays, most of the internet advertisements are not statically       linked to a web page. Instead, what will be shown to the person       opening a web page is determined within 100 milliseconds after the       web page is opened. Usually, multiple companies compete for each       ad slot on the web page in an auction. Each of them receives a       request with details about the user, web page and ad slot and they       have to respond within those 100 milliseconds with a bid they       would pay for putting an advertisement on that ad slot. The       company that suggests the highest bid wins the auction and gets to       place its advertisement.

521,"Vasya is sitting on an extremely boring math class. To have fun,       he took a piece of paper and wrote out  n numbers on a single line. After that, Vasya       began to write out different ways to put pluses (""+"") in the line between       certain digits in the line so that the result was a correct       arithmetic expression; formally, no two pluses in such a partition       can stand together (between any two adjacent pluses there must be       at least one digit), and no plus can stand at the beginning or the       end of a line.

The       BerAvia company stewardess is giving food consecutively to all the       passengers from the 1-th one to the       last one. Polycarp is sitting on seat  m, that means, he will be the  m-th person to get food. The flight menu has  k dishes in total and when Polycarp boarded the       flight, he had time to count the number of portions of each dish       on board. Thus, he knows values  a 1, a 2, ..., a  k, where  a  i is the number of portions of the  i-th dish. The stewardess has already given food to  m - 1 passengers, gave Polycarp a polite smile and       asked him what he would prefer. That's when Polycarp realized that       they might have run out of some dishes by that moment. For some of       the  m - 1 passengers ahead of him, he noticed what       dishes they were given. Besides, he's heard some strange mumbling       from some of the  m - 1 passengers ahead of him, similar to phrase       'I'm disappointed'. That happened when a passenger asked for some       dish but the stewardess gave him a polite smile and said that they       had run out of that dish. In that case the passenger needed to       choose some other dish that was available. If Polycarp heard no       more sounds from a passenger, that meant that the passenger chose       his dish at the first try. Help Polycarp to find out for each dish: whether they could have       run out of the dish by the moment Polyarp was served or that dish       was definitely available.","Each test in this problem consists of one or more input sets.       First goes a string that contains a single integer  t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100 000) — the number of       input data sets in the test. Then the sets follow, each set is       preceded by an empty line. The first line of each set of the input contains integers  m,  k (2 ≤ m ≤ 100 000, 1 ≤ k ≤ 100 000) — the number of       Polycarp's seat and the number of dishes, respectively. The second line contains a sequence of  k integers  a 1, a 2, ..., a  k (1 ≤ a  i ≤ 100 000), where  a  i is the initial number of portions of the          i-th dish. Then  m - 1 lines follow, each line contains the       description of Polycarp's observations about giving food to a       passenger sitting in front of him: the  j-th line contains a pair of integers  t  j, r  j (0 ≤ t  j ≤ k, 0 ≤ r  j ≤ 1), where  t  j is the number of the dish that was given       to the  j-th passenger (or 0, if Polycarp didn't notice       what dish was given to the passenger), and  r  j — a 1 or a 0, depending on whether the          j-th passenger was or wasn't disappointed, respectively. We know that sum  a  i equals at least  m, that is,Polycarp will definitely get some dish,       even if it is the last thing he wanted. It is guaranteed that the       data is consistent. Sum  m for all input sets doesn't exceed 100 000. Sum  k for all input sets doesn't exceed 100 000.","For each input set print the answer as a single line. Print a       string of  k letters ""Y"" or ""N"". Letter ""Y"" in position  i should be printed if they could have run out of       the  i-th dish by the time the stewardess started       serving Polycarp.","In the first input set depending on the choice of the second       passenger the situation could develop in different ways: Thus, the answer is ""YNNY"". In the second input set there is, for example, the following       possible scenario. First, the first passenger takes the only third       dish, then the second passenger takes the second dish. Then, the       third passenger asks for the third dish, but it is not available,       so he makes disappointed muttering and ends up with the second       dish. Then the fourth passenger takes the fourth dish, and       Polycarp ends up with the choice between the first, fourth and       fifth dish. Likewise, another possible scenario is when by the time the       stewardess comes to Polycarp, they will have run out of either the       first or the fifth dish (this can happen if one of these dishes is       taken by the second passenger). It is easy to see that there is       more than enough of the fourth dish, so Polycarp can always count       on it. Thus, the answer is ""YYYNY""."

569,"Rikhail Mubinchik believes that the current definition of prime       numbers is obsolete as they are too complex and unpredictable. A       palindromic number is another matter. It is aesthetically       pleasing, and it has a number of remarkable properties. Help       Rikhail to convince the scientific community in this! Let us remind you that a number is called prime if it is integer larger       than one, and is not divisible by any positive integer other than       itself and one. Rikhail calls a number a palindromic if it is integer,       positive, and its decimal representation without leading zeros is       a palindrome, i.e. reads the same from left to right and right to left. One problem with prime numbers is that there are too many of       them. Let's introduce the following notation: π(n) — the number of primes no       larger than  n,  rub(n) — the number of palindromic numbers       no larger than  n. Rikhail wants to prove that there are a lot       more primes than palindromic ones.

The main character of this game has  n different skills, each of which is characterized       by an integer  a  i from 0 to 100. The higher the number          a  i is, the higher is the  i-th skill of the character.

The expression ⌊       x⌋ denotes the result of rounding the number  x down to       the nearest integer. At the beginning of the game Petya got  k improvement units as a bonus that he can use to       increase the skills of his character and his total rating. One       improvement unit can increase any skill of Petya's character by       exactly one. For example, if  a 4 = 46, after using one       imporvement unit to this skill, it becomes equal to 47. A hero's       skill cannot rise higher more than 100. Thus, it is permissible       that some of the units will remain unused.

Petya       has to improve the first skill to 10 by spending 3 improvement       units, and the second skill to 10, by spending one improvement       unit. Thus, Petya spends all his improvement units and the total       rating of the character becomes equal to  lfloor frac{100}{10} rfloor +          lfloor frac{100}{10}       rfloor = 10 + 10 =  20. In the second test the optimal strategy for Petya is to improve       the first skill to 20 (by spending 3 improvement units) and to       improve the third skill to 20 (in this case by spending 1       improvement units). Thus, Petya is left with 4 improvement units       and he will be able to increase the second skill to 19 (which does       not change the overall rating, so Petya does not necessarily have       to do it). Therefore, the highest possible total rating in this       example is . In the third test case the optimal strategy for Petya is to       increase the first skill to 100 by spending 1 improvement unit.

585,"Alice and Bob decided to eat some fruit. In the kitchen they       found a large bag of oranges and apples. Alice immediately took an       orange for herself, Bob took an apple. To make the process of       sharing the remaining fruit more fun, the friends decided to play       a game. They put multiple cards and on each one they wrote a       letter, either 'A', or the       letter 'B'. Then they began       to remove the cards one by one from left to right, every time they       removed a card with the letter 'A', Alice gave Bob all the fruits       she had at that moment and took out of the bag as many apples and       as many oranges as she had before. Thus the number of oranges and       apples Alice had, did not change. If the card had written letter         'B', then Bob did the       same, that is, he gave Alice all the fruit that he had, and took       from the bag the same set of fruit. After the last card way       removed, all the fruit in the bag were over. You know how many oranges and apples was in the bag at first.       Your task is to find any sequence of cards that Alice and Bob       could have played with.","The first line of the input contains two integers,  x, y (1 ≤ x, y ≤ 1018, xy > 1) — the       number of oranges and apples that were initially in the bag.","Print any sequence of cards that would meet the problem       conditions as a compressed       string of characters 'A'       and 'B. That means that you       need to replace the segments of identical consecutive characters       by the number of repetitions of the characters and the actual       character. For example, string AAABAABBB should be replaced by       string 3A1B2A3B, but cannot       be replaced by 2A1A1B2A3B       or by 3AB2A3B. See the       samples for clarifications of the output format. The string that       you print should consist of at most 106 characters. It is guaranteed       that if the answer exists, its compressed representation exists,       consisting of at most 106 characters. If there are       several possible answers, you are allowed to print any of them. If the sequence of cards that meet the problem statement does not       not exist, print a single word Impossible.","In the first sample, if the row contained three cards with letter         'B', then Bob should give       one apple to Alice three times. So, in the end of the game Alice       has one orange and three apples, and Bob has one apple, in total       it is one orange and four apples. In second sample, there is no answer since one card is not enough       for game to finish, and two cards will produce at least three       apples or three oranges. In the third sample, cards contain letters 'AB', so after removing the first       card Bob has one orange and one apple, and after removal of second       card Alice has two oranges and one apple. So, in total it is three       oranges and two apples."

The children in the       queue after the  v  i-th child almost do not hear the crying,       so their confidence remains unchanged. If at any point in time the confidence of the  j-th child is less than zero, he begins to cry       with the volume of  d  j and leaves the line, running towards the       exit, without going to the doctor's office.

In addition, it was decided that a       road between the states should be built to guarantee so that one       could any point of any country can be reached from any point of       any other State. Since roads are always expensive, the governments of the states       of the newly formed alliance asked you to help them assess the       costs.

He has recently read an encyclopedia article that       described the method of median       smoothing (or median filter) and its many applications in       science and engineering. Vasya liked the idea of the method very       much, and he decided to try it in practice. Applying the simplest variant of median smoothing to the sequence       of numbers  a 1, a 2, ..., a  n will result a new sequence  b 1, b 2, ..., b  n obtained by the following algorithm: The median of a set of       three numbers is the number that goes on the second place, when       these three numbers are written in the non-decreasing order. For       example, the median of the set 5, 1, 2 is number 2, and the median       of set 1, 0, 1 is equal to 1. In order to make the task easier, Vasya decided to apply the       method to sequences consisting of zeros and ones only. Having made the procedure once, Vasya looked at the resulting       sequence and thought: what if I apply the algorithm to it once       again, and then apply it to the next result, and so on? Vasya       tried a couple of examples and found out that after some number of       median smoothing algorithm applications the sequence can stop       changing. We say that the sequence is stable, if it does not change       when the median smoothing is applied to it. Now Vasya wonders, whether the sequence always eventually becomes       stable. He asks you to write a program that, given a sequence of       zeros and ones, will determine whether it ever becomes stable.       Moreover, if it ever becomes stable, then you should determine       what will it look like and how many times one needs to apply the       median smoothing algorithm to initial sequence in order to obtain       a stable one.","The first input line of the input contains a single integer  n (3 ≤ n ≤ 500 000) — the length of       the initial sequence.

594,"Edo has got a collection of  n refrigerator magnets! He decided to buy a refrigerator and hang the magnets on the       door. The shop can make the refrigerator with any size of the door       that meets the following restrictions: the refrigerator door must       be rectangle, and both the length and the width of the door must       be positive integers. Edo figured out how he wants to place the magnets on the       refrigerator. He introduced a system of coordinates on the plane,       where each magnet is represented as a rectangle with sides       parallel to the coordinate axes. Now he wants to remove no more than  k magnets (he may choose to keep all of them) and       attach all remaining magnets to the refrigerator door, and the       area of ​​the door should be as small as possible. A magnet is       considered to be attached to the refrigerator door if its center lies on the door or       on its boundary. The relative positions of all the remaining       magnets must correspond to the plan. Let us explain the last two sentences. Let's suppose we want to       hang two magnets on the refrigerator. If the magnet in the plan       has coordinates of the lower left corner ( x 1,  y 1) and the upper right       corner ( x 2,  y 2), then its center is       located at (,         )       (may not be integers). By saying the relative position should       correspond to the plan we mean that the only available operation       is translation, i.e. the vector connecting the centers of two       magnets in the original plan, must be equal to the vector       connecting the centers of these two magnets on the refrigerator.  The sides of the refrigerator door         must also be parallel to coordinate axes.","The first line contains two integers  n and  k (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000, 0 ≤ k ≤ min(10, n - 1)) —       the number of magnets that Edo has and the maximum number of       magnets Edo may not place on the refrigerator.

If we remove the first magnet, the centers of       two others will lie at points (2.5, 2.5) and (3.5, 3.5). Thus, it       is enough to buy a fridge with door width 1 and door height 1, the       area of the door also equals one, correspondingly. In the second test sample it doesn't matter which magnet to       remove, the answer will not change — we need a fridge with door       width 8 and door height 8.

After that Vova's character takes the       position with the lesser coordinate and Lesha's character takes       the position with the bigger coordinate and the guys start fighting. Vova and Lesha are already tired by the game of choosing       positions, as they need to play it before every fight, so they       asked you (the developer of the The Ancient Papyri: Swordsink) to       write a module that would automatically determine the distance at       which the warrior and the archer will start fighting if both Vova       and Lesha play optimally.","The first line on the input contains a single integer  n (2 ≤ n ≤ 200 000,  n is even) — the number of positions available       initially.

596,"Wilbur is playing with a set of  n points on the coordinate plane. All points have       non-negative integer coordinates. Moreover, if some point ( x,  y) belongs to the set, then all points ( x',  y'), such that 0 ≤ x' ≤ x and 0 ≤ y' ≤ y also belong to       this set. Now Wilbur wants to number the points in the set he has, that is       assign them distinct integer numbers from 1 to  n. In order to make the numbering aesthetically pleasing, Wilbur       imposes the condition that if some point ( x,  y) gets number  i, then all ( x', y') from the set, such that  x' ≥ x and  y' ≥ y must be assigned a number not less       than  i. For example, for a set of four points (0, 0),         (0, 1), (1,         0) and (1, 1), there       are two aesthetically pleasing numberings. One is 1, 2, 3, 4 and       another one is 1, 3, 2, 4. Wilbur's friend comes along and challenges Wilbur. For any point       he defines it's special       value as  s(x, y) = y - x. Now       he gives Wilbur some  w 1,  w 2,...,  w  n, and asks him to find an aesthetically       pleasing numbering of the points in the set, such that the point       that gets number  i has it's special value equal to  w  i, that is  s(x  i, y  i) = y  i - x  i = w  i.

Kevin is a big proponent of alternative       thinking and believes that his score, instead of being the sum of       his points, should be the length of the longest alternating       subsequence of his string.

607,"In the spirit of the holidays, Saitama has given Genos two grid       paths of length  n (a weird gift even by Saitama's standards). A       grid path is an ordered sequence of neighbouring squares in an       infinite grid. Two squares are neighbouring if they share a side. One example of a grid path is (0, 0) → (0, 1) → (0, 2) → (1, 2) → (1, 1) → (0, 1) → ( - 1, 1).       Note that squares in this sequence might be repeated, i.e. path       has self intersections. Movement within a grid path is restricted to adjacent squares       within the sequence. That is, from the  i-th square, one can only move to the (i - 1)-th or (i + 1)-th squares of this path.       Note that there is only a single valid move from the first and       last squares of a grid path. Also note, that even if there is some          j-th square of the path that coincides with the          i-th square, only moves to (i - 1)-th and (i + 1)-th squares are available.       For example, from the second square in the above sequence, one can       only move to either the first or third squares. To ensure that movement is not ambiguous, the two grid paths will       not have an alternating sequence of three squares. For example, a       contiguous subsequence (0, 0) → (0, 1) → (0, 0) cannot occur in a valid grid path. One marble is placed on the first square of each grid path. Genos       wants to get both marbles to the last square of each grid path.       However, there is a catch. Whenever he moves one marble, the other       marble will copy its movement if possible. For instance, if one       marble moves east, then the other marble will try and move east as well. By         try, we mean if moving       east is a valid move, then the marble will move east. Moving north increases the second coordinate by 1, while moving south decreases it by         1. Similarly, moving east       increases first coordinate by 1,       while moving west decreases it. Given these two valid grid paths, Genos wants to know if it is       possible to move both marbles to the ends of their respective       paths.

Two cells (r 1, c 1) (located in the row          r 1 and column  c 1) and (r 2, c 2) are connected if there exists a       sequence of empty cells that starts with (r 1, c 1), finishes with (r 2, c 2), and any two       consecutive cells in this sequence are directly connected.

680," This is an interactive problem. In         the output section below you will see the information about         flushing the output. Bear Limak thinks of some hidden number — an integer from       interval [2, 100]. Your task is to       say if the hidden number is prime or composite. Integer  x > 1 is called prime if it has exactly two       distinct divisors, 1 and  x. If integer  x > 1 is not prime, it's called composite. You can ask up to 20 queries about       divisors of the hidden number. In each query you should print an       integer from interval [2, 100]. The       system will answer ""yes"" if your integer is a       divisor of the hidden number. Otherwise, the answer will be         ""no"". For example, if the hidden number is 14 then the system will answer ""yes"" only if you print 2, 7 or         14. When you are done asking queries, print ""prime"" or ""composite"" and terminate       your program. You will get the Wrong       Answer verdict if you ask more than 20 queries, or if you print an integer not       from the range [2, 100]. Also, you       will get the Wrong Answer       verdict if the printed answer isn't correct. You will get the Idleness Limit       Exceeded verdict if you don't print anything (but you       should) or if you forget about flushing the output (more info below).","After each query you should read one string from the input. It       will be ""yes"" if       the printed integer is a divisor of the hidden number, and         ""no"" otherwise.","Up to 20 times you can ask a       query — print an integer from interval [2, 100] in one line. You have to both       print the end-of-line character and flush the output. After flushing       you should read a response from the input. In any moment you can print the answer ""prime"" or ""composite"" (without the       quotes). After that, flush the output and terminate your program. To flush you can use (just after printing an integer and       end-of-line):   Hacking. To hack someone,       as the input you should print the hidden number — one integer from       the interval [2, 100]. Of course,       his/her solution won't be able to read the hidden number from the input.","The hidden number in the first query is 30. In a table below you can see a better       form of the provided example of the communication process.   The hidden number is divisible by both 2 and 5.       Thus, it must be composite. Note that it isn't necessary to know       the exact value of the hidden number. In this test, the hidden       number is 30.    59 is a divisor of the hidden       number. In the interval [2, 100]       there is only one number with this divisor. The hidden number must       be 59, which is prime. Note that the       answer is known even after the second query and you could print it       then and terminate. Though, it isn't forbidden to ask unnecessary       queries (unless you exceed the limit of 20 queries)."
681,"Petya has recently learned data structure named ""Binary heap"". The heap he is now operating with allows the following       operations:  Thus, at any moment of time the heap contains several integers       (possibly none), some of them might be equal. In order to better learn this data structure Petya took an empty       heap and applied some operations above to it. Also, he carefully       wrote down all the operations and their results to his event log,       following the format:  All the operations were correct, i.e. there was at least one       element in the heap each time getMin or removeMin operations were applied. While Petya was away for a lunch, his little brother Vova came to       the room, took away some of the pages from Petya's log and used       them to make paper boats. Now Vova is worried, if he made Petya's sequence of operations       inconsistent. For example, if one apply operations one-by-one in       the order they are written in the event log, results of getMin operations might differ       from the results recorded by Petya, and some of getMin or removeMin operations may be       incorrect, as the heap is empty at the moment they are applied. Now Vova wants to add some new operation records to the event log       in order to make the resulting sequence of operations correct.       That is, the result of each getMin operation is equal to the       result in the record, and the heap is non-empty when getMin ad removeMin are applied. Vova wants       to complete this as fast as possible, as the Petya may get back at       any moment. He asks you to add the least possible number of       operation records to the current log.

Next  m lines should contain the corrected sequence of       records following the format of the input (described in the       statement), one per line and in the order they are applied. All       the numbers in the output should be integers not exceeding 109 by       their absolute value. Note that the input sequence of operations must be the subsequence of the output sequence. It's guaranteed that there exists the correct answer consisting       of no more than 1 000 000 operations.","In the first sample, after number 3       is inserted into the heap, the minimum number is 3. To make the result of the first getMin equal to 4 one should firstly remove number 3 from the heap and then add number 4 into the heap. In the second sample case number 1       is inserted two times, so should be similarly removed twice."

In this game there are three identical cups arranged in       a line from left to right. Initially key to Barney's heart is       under the middle cup. Then at one turn Barney swaps the cup in the middle with any of       other two cups randomly (he choses each with equal probability),       so the chosen cup becomes the middle one. Game lasts  n turns and Barney independently choses a cup to       swap with the middle one within each turn, and the key always       remains in the cup it was at the start. After  n-th turn Barney asks a girl to guess which cup       contains the key. The girl points to the middle one but Barney was       distracted while making turns and doesn't know if the key is under       the middle cup.

707,"Katya studies in a fifth grade. Recently her class studied right       triangles and the Pythagorean theorem.

In this problem you should guess an array  a which is unknown for you. The only information       you have initially is the length  n of the array  a. The only allowed action is to ask the sum of two elements by       their indices. Formally, you can print two indices  i and  j (the indices should be distinct). Then your program       should read the response: the single integer equals to  a  i + a  j. It is easy to prove that it is always possible to guess the array       using at most  n requests. Write a program that will guess the array  a by making at most  n requests. In each test your program should guess a single array. The input starts with a line containing integer  n (3 ≤ n ≤ 5000) — the length of the       array. Your program should read it at first. After that your program should print to the standard output the       requests about the sum of two elements or inform that the array is guessed.

Your task is to determine the minimum time Igor needs to get from       the point  x 1 to the point  x 2, if it is known where       the tram is and in what direction it goes at the moment Igor comes       to the point  x 1. Igor can enter the tram unlimited number of times at any moment       when his and the tram's positions coincide. It is not obligatory that points in       which Igor enter and exit the tram are integers. Assume that any       boarding and unboarding happens instantly. Igor can move arbitrary       along the line (but not faster than 1 meter per  t 2 seconds). He can also       stand at some point for some time.","The first line contains three integers  s,  x 1 and  x 2 (2 ≤ s ≤ 1000, 0 ≤ x 1, x 2 ≤ s,  x 1 ≠ x 2) — the maximum       coordinate of the point to which the tram goes, the point Igor is       at, and the point he should come to. The second line contains two integers  t 1 and  t 2 (1 ≤ t 1, t 2 ≤ 1000) — the time in       seconds in which the tram passes 1       meter and the time in seconds in which Igor passes 1 meter. The third line contains two integers  p and  d (1 ≤ p ≤ s - 1,  d is either 1 or         ) —       the position of the tram in the moment Igor came to the point          x 1 and the direction of the       tram at this moment. If ,       the tram goes in the direction from the point  s to the point 0. If          d = 1, the tram goes in the direction from the       point 0 to the point  s.",Print the minimum time in seconds which Igor needs to get from       the point  x 1 to the point  x 2.,"In the first example it is profitable for Igor to go by foot and       not to wait the tram. Thus, he has to pass 2 meters and it takes 8 seconds in total, because he passes         1 meter per 4 seconds.  In the second example Igor can, for example, go towards the point          x 2 and get to the point         1 in 6 seconds (because he has to pass 3 meters, but he passes 1 meters per 2 seconds). At that moment the tram will       be at the point 1, so Igor can enter       the tram and pass 1 meter in 1 second. Thus, Igor will reach the point          x 2 in 7 seconds in total."

753," The only difference from the         previous problem is the constraint on the number of requests. In         this problem your program should guess the answer doing at most         7 requests. This problem is a little bit unusual. Here you are to implement       an interaction with a testing system. That means that you can make       queries and get responses in the online mode. Please be sure to       use the stream flushing operation after each query's output in       order not to leave part of your output in some buffer. For       example, in C++ you've got to use the fflush(stdout) function, in Java       — call System.out.flush(),       and in Pascal — flush(output). Bulls and Cows (also known as Cows and Bulls or Pigs and Bulls or       Bulls and Cleots) is an old code-breaking paper and pencil game       for two players, predating the similar commercially marketed board       game Mastermind. On a sheet of paper, the first player thinks a secret string.       This string consists only of digits and has the length 4. The digits in the string must be all different, no two or       more equal digits are allowed. Then the second player tries to guess his opponent's string. For       every guess the first player gives the number of matches. If the       matching digits are on their right positions, they are       ""bulls"", if on different positions, they are       ""cows"". Thus a response is a pair of numbers — the       number of ""bulls"" and the number of ""cows"". A       try can contain equal digits. More formally, let's the secret string is  s and the second player are trying to guess it       with a string  x. The number of ""bulls"" is a number of       such positions  i (1 ≤ i ≤ 4)       where  s[i] = x[i]. The number of       ""cows"" is a number of such digits  c that  s contains  c in the position  i (i.e.  s[i] = c),  x contains  c, but  x[i] ≠ c. For example, the secret string is ""0427"", the opponent's try is         ""0724"", then       the answer is 2 bulls and 2 cows (the bulls are ""0"" and       ""2"", the cows are ""4"" and ""7""). If       the secret string is ""0123"", the opponent's try is         ""0330"", then       the answer is 1 bull and 1 cow. In this problem you are to guess the string  s that the system has chosen. You only know that       the chosen string consists of 4       distinct digits. You can make queries to the testing system, each query is the       output of a single 4-digit string.       The answer to the query is the number of bulls and number of cows.       If the system's response equals ""4 0"", that means the       interaction with your problem is over and the program must       terminate. That is possible for two reasons — the program either       guessed the number  x or made an invalid action (for example, printed       letters instead of digits). You can hack solutions of other participants providing a 4-digit       string containing distinct digits — the secret string.","To read answers to the queries, the program must use the standard input. The program will receive pairs of non-negative integers in the       input, one pair per line. The first number in a pair is a number       of bulls and the second one is a number of cows of the string          s and the string  x  i printed by your program. If the system       response equals ""4 0"", then your solution should terminate. The testing system will let your program read the  i-th pair of integers from the input only after       your program displays the corresponding system query in the       output: prints value  x  i in a single line and executes operation         flush.","The program must use the standard output to print queries. Your program must output requests — 4-digit strings  x 1, x 2, ..., one per line.       After the output of each line the program must execute flush operation. The program       should read the answer to the query from the standard input.  Your program is allowed to do at         most 7 queries.","The secret string  s in the example is ""0123""."

Also, if two Pokemon have different       types before evolving, they will have different types after       evolving. It is also possible that a Pokemon has the same type       before and after evolving.  Formally, an evolution       plan is a permutation  f of {1, 2, ..., m}, such that  f(x) = y means that a Pokemon of       type  x evolves into a Pokemon of type  y. The gym leaders are intrigued by the special evolution camp and       all of them plan to evolve their Pokemons. The protocol of the       mountain states that in each gym, for every type of Pokemon, the       number of Pokemon of that type before evolving any Pokemon should       be equal the number of Pokemon of that type after evolving all the       Pokemons according to the evolution plan. They now want to find       out how many distinct evolution       plans exist which satisfy the protocol. Two evolution plans  f 1 and  f 2 are distinct, if they       have at least one Pokemon type evolving into a different Pokemon       type in the two plans, i. e. there exists an  i such that  f 1(i) ≠ f 2(i). Your task is to find how many distinct evolution plans are possible       such that if all Pokemon in all the gyms are evolved, the number       of Pokemon of each type in each of the gyms remains the same. As       the answer can be large, output it modulo 109 + 7.","The first line contains two integers  n and  m (1 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 106) — the number of gyms and the       number of Pokemon types.

After that  g  i integers follow, denoting types of the       Pokemons in the  i-th gym. Each of these integers is between 1 and  m.

He wrote it on a magical paper       but he was surprised because some characters disappeared while       writing the string. That's because this magical paper doesn't       allow character number  i in the English alphabet to be written on it in a       string of length more than  a  i.

771,"A tree is an undirected connected graph without cycles. The       distance between two vertices is the number of edges in a simple       path between them. Limak is a little polar bear. He lives in a tree that consists of          n vertices, numbered 1 through  n. Limak recently learned how to jump. He can jump from a vertex to       any vertex within distance at most  k. For a pair of vertices (s, t) we define  f(s, t) as the minimum number of       jumps Limak needs to get from  s to  t. Your task is to find the sum of  f(s, t) over all pairs of vertices         (s, t) such that          s < t.","The first line of the input contains two integers  n and  k (2 ≤ n ≤ 200 000, 1 ≤ k ≤ 5) — the number of vertices       in the tree and the maximum allowed jump distance respectively. The next  n - 1 lines describe edges in the tree. The  i-th of those lines contains two integers  a  i and  b  i (1 ≤ a  i, b  i ≤ n) — the indices on vertices       connected with  i-th edge. It's guaranteed that the given edges form a tree.","Print one integer, denoting the sum of  f(s, t) over all pairs of vertices         (s, t) such that          s < t.","In the first sample, the given tree has 6 vertices and it's displayed on the       drawing below. Limak can jump to any vertex within distance at       most 2. For example, from the vertex         5 he can jump to any of vertices:         1, 2       and 4 (well, he can also jump to the       vertex 5 itself). There are        pairs of vertices (s, t) such that  s < t. For 5 of those pairs Limak would need two       jumps: (1, 6), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (5, 6).       For other 10 pairs one jump is       enough. So, the answer is 5·2 + 10·1 = 20. In the third sample, Limak can jump between every two vertices       directly. There are 3 pairs of       vertices (s < t),       so the answer is 3·1 = 3."

778,"Peterson loves to learn new languages, but his favorite hobby is       making new ones. Language is a set of words, and word is a       sequence of lowercase Latin letters. Peterson makes new language every morning. It is difficult task       to store the whole language, so Peterson have invented new data       structure for storing his languages which is called broom. Broom is rooted       tree with edges marked with letters. Initially broom is       represented by the only vertex — the root of the broom. When       Peterson wants to add new word to the language he stands at the       root and processes the letters of new word one by one. Consider       that Peterson stands at the vertex  u. If there is an edge from  u marked with current letter, Peterson goes       through this edge. Otherwise Peterson adds new edge from  u to the new vertex  v, marks it with the current letter and goes       through the new edge. Size of broom is the number of vertices in it.

Peterson tries to make his language as simple       as possible, so he wants to choose  p such that the size of the broom for his       simplified language is as small as possible.

809,"After a wonderful evening in the restaurant the time to go home       came. Leha as a true gentlemen suggested Noora to give her a lift.       Certainly the girl agreed with pleasure. Suddenly one problem       appeared: Leha cannot find his car on a huge parking near the       restaurant. So he decided to turn to the watchman for help. Formally the parking can be represented as a matrix 109 × 109. There is exactly one car in       every cell of the matrix. All cars have their own machine numbers       represented as a positive integer. Let's index the columns of the       matrix by integers from 1 to 109       from left to right and the rows by integers from 1 to 109 from top to bottom.

For each request       Leha asks the watchman to tell him the resulting sum. Due to the       fact that the sum can turn out to be quite large, hacker asks to       calculate it modulo 109 + 7. However the requests seem to be impracticable for the watchman.

Initially the players have a string  s consisting of the first  a English letters in alphabetical order (for       example, if  a = 5, then  s equals to ""abcde""). The players take turns appending letters to string  s. Mister B moves first. Mister B must append exactly  b letters on each his move. He can arbitrary       choose these letters. His opponent adds exactly  a letters on each move. Mister B quickly understood that his opponent was just a computer       that used a simple algorithm.

For each person we know in which direction (left or right) he is       facing, and his maximum speed. You can put a bomb in some point with non-negative integer       coordinate, and blow it up. At this moment all people will start       running with their maximum speed in the direction they are facing.       Also, two strange rays will start propagating from the bomb with       speed  s: one to the right, and one to the left. Of       course, the speed  s is strictly greater than people's maximum speed. The rays are strange because if at any moment the position and       the direction of movement of some ray and some person coincide,       then the speed of the person immediately increases by the speed of       the ray.

833,"Recently, a wild Krakozyabra appeared at Jelly Castle. It is,       truth to be said, always eager to have something for dinner. Its favorite meal is natural numbers (typically served with honey       sauce), or, to be more precise, the zeros in their corresponding       decimal representations. As for other digits, Krakozyabra dislikes       them; moreover, they often cause it indigestion! So, as a       necessary precaution, Krakozyabra prefers to sort the digits of a       number in non-descending order before proceeding to feast. Then,       the leading zeros of the resulting number are eaten and the       remaining part is discarded as an inedible tail. For example, if Krakozyabra is to have the number 57040 for dinner, its inedible tail would be the       number 457.

847,"Recall that the bracket sequence is considered regular if it is       possible to insert symbols '+' and '1' into it so that the result is       a correct arithmetic expression.

Also the       following sequences are regular: ""()()()"", ""(())"" and ""()"". The following sequences       are not regular bracket sequences: "")("", ""(()"" and ""())(()"". In this problem you are given two integers  n and  k. Your task is to construct a regular bracket       sequence consisting of round brackets with length 2·n with total sum of nesting of       all opening brackets equals to exactly  k. The nesting of a single opening bracket equals       to the number of pairs of brackets in which current opening       bracket is embedded. For example, in the sequence ""()(())"" the nesting of first       opening bracket equals to 0, the       nesting of the second opening bracket equals to 0 and the nesting of the third opening       bracket equal to 1.

So the total       sum of nestings equals to 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 = 6. In the third it is impossible to construct a regular bracket       sequence, because the maximum possible total sum of nestings for       two opening brackets equals to 1.

The only exception is that if the block of       consonants has all letters the same, then this block (even if its       length is greater than three) is not considered a typo. Formally,       a word is typed with a typo if there is a block of not less that       three consonants in a row, and there are at least two different       letters in this block. For example: When Beroffice editor finds a word with a typo, it inserts as       little as possible number of spaces in this word (dividing it into       several words) in such a way that each of the resulting words is       typed without any typos. Implement this feature of Beroffice editor. Consider the       following letters as the only vowels: 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o' and 'u'. All the other letters are       consonants in this problem.",The only line contains a non-empty word consisting of small       English letters. The length of the word is between 1 and 3000 letters.,"Print the given word without any changes if there are no typos. If there is at least one typo in the word, insert the minimum       number of spaces into the word so that each of the resulting words       doesn't have any typos. If there are multiple solutions, print any       of them.",

So now Ilya wants to compare his robots' performance in a simple       game called ""1-2-3"". This game is similar to the       ""Rock-Paper-Scissors"" game: both robots secretly choose       a number from the set {1, 2, 3} and       say it at the same moment. If both robots choose the same number,       then it's a draw and noone gets any points. But if chosen numbers       are different, then one of the robots gets a point: 3 beats 2,         2 beats 1 and 1       beats 3.  Both robots' programs make them choose their numbers in such a       way that their choice in (i + 1)-th game depends only on the       numbers chosen by them in  i-th game.  Ilya knows that the robots will play  k games, Alice will choose number  a in the first game, and Bob will choose  b in the first game. He also knows both robots'       programs and can tell what each robot will choose depending on       their choices in previous game.

After starting from the point  x = 0, it reaches the point  x = a, immediately turns back and then       moves to the point  x = 0. After returning to the point  x = 0 it immediately goes back to the point  x = a and so on. Thus, the bus moves from          x = 0 to  x = a and back. Moving from the point  x = 0 to  x = a or from the point  x = a to  x = 0 is called a bus journey. In total, the bus       must make  k journeys. The petrol tank of the bus can hold  b liters of gasoline. To pass a single unit of       distance the bus needs to spend exactly one liter of gasoline. The       bus starts its first journey with a full petrol tank. There is a gas station in point  x = f. This point is between points  x = 0 and  x = a. There are no other gas stations on       the bus route. While passing by a gas station in either direction       the bus can stop and completely refuel its tank.

Some long and uninteresting story         was removed... The alphabet of Bookland is so large that its letters are denoted       by positive integers. Each letter can be small or large, the large       version of a letter  x is denoted by  x'. BSCII encoding, which is used everywhere in       Bookland, is made in that way so that large letters are presented       in the order of the numbers they are denoted by, and small letters       are presented in the order of the numbers they are denoted by, but       all large letters are before all small letters. For       example, the following conditions hold: 2 < 3, 2' < 3', 3' < 2. A word  x 1, x 2, ..., x  a is not lexicographically greater than          y 1, y 2, ..., y  b if one of the two following conditions       holds:  For example, the word ""3' 7 5"" is before the word ""2 4' 6"" in lexicographical order. It is       said that sequence of words is in lexicographical order if each       word is not lexicographically greater than the next word in the sequence. Denis has a sequence of words consisting of small letters only.       He wants to change some letters to large (let's call this process       a capitalization) in such a       way that the sequence of words is in lexicographical order.       However, he soon realized that for some reason he can't change a       single letter in a single word. He only can choose a letter and       change all of its occurrences in all words to large letters. He       can perform this operation any number of times with arbitrary       letters of Bookland's alphabet.

The second word is the prefix of the third word, so the are       in lexicographical order.

879,"Petya learned a new programming language CALPAS. A program in       this language always takes one non-negative integer and returns       one non-negative integer as well.

A program can contain an arbitrary sequence of these       operations with arbitrary constants from 0 to 1023.       When the program is run, all operations are applied (in the given       order) to the argument and in the end the result integer is returned.

She has never seen this problem before, but, being an       experienced participant, she guessed that she should match trees       to some sequences and then compare these sequences instead of       trees.

Unfortunately, this time Sasha's intuition was wrong, and there       could be several trees matching the same sequence.

Every enemy can receive damage, as well as be healed. There are       multiple ways of doing so, but Vlad is not interested in details.

In the first sample case, Vlad can activate the ability at the         50-th second: the enemies 2 and 3 will       die since they would have 40 and         50 health points correspondingly.       Vlad will earn 2·(1000 + 50·10) = 3000 gold. In the second sample case, the maximum amount of health for the       enemy 1 is less than the damage       dealt by the ability. Hence, the enemy could be killed anytime. As       the bounty increases by 50 over the       time, the maximum possible amount of gold is infinite."

You think that this photo can contain a zebra. In this case the       whole photo should consist of several (possibly, only one)       alternating black and white stripes of equal width. For example,       the photo [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0] can be a photo       of zebra, while the photo [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1] can not, because the       width of the black stripe is 3,       while the width of the white stripe is 4. Can the given photo be a photo of zebra       or not?","The first line contains a single integer  n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000) — the width of the photo. The second line contains a sequence of integers  a 1, a 2, ..., a  n (0 ≤ a  i ≤ 1) — the description of the photo. If          a  i is zero, the  i-th column is all black. If  a  i is one, then the  i-th column is all white.","If the photo can be a photo of zebra, print ""YES"" (without quotes).       Otherwise, print ""NO"". You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).","The first two examples are described in the statements. In the third example all pixels are white, so the photo can be a       photo of zebra. In the fourth example the width of the first stripe is equal to       three (white color), the width of the second stripe is equal to       three (black), and the width of the third stripe is equal to two       (white). Thus, not all stripes have equal length, so this photo is       not a photo of zebra."
928,"Polycarp is currently developing a project in Vaja language and       using a popular dependency management system called Vamen. From       Vamen's point of view both Vaja project and libraries are treated       projects for simplicity. A project in Vaja has its own uniqie non-empty name consisting of       lowercase latin letters with length not exceeding 10 and version — positive integer from         1 to 106. Each project (keep in mind       that it is determined by both its name and version) might depend       on other projects. For sure, there are no cyclic dependencies. You're given a list of project descriptions. The first of the given projects       is the one being developed by Polycarp at this moment. Help       Polycarp determine all projects that his project depends on       (directly or via a certain chain).  It's possible that Polycarp's project depends on two different       versions of some project. In this case collision resolving is       applied, i.e. for each such project the system chooses the version       that minimizes the distance from it to Polycarp's project. If       there are several options, the newer (with the maximum version) is       preferred. This version is considered actual; other versions and their dependencies         are ignored. More formal, choose such a set of projects of minimum possible       size that the following conditions hold:  Output all Polycarp's project's dependencies (Polycarp's project       itself should't be printed) in lexicographical order.","The first line contains an only integer  n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1 000) — the number of       projects in Vaja.

One day Teodor       noticed that picture he just drawn has one interesting feature:       there doesn't exist an integer point, that belongs each of       segments in the picture. Having discovered this fact, Teodor       decided to share it with Sasha. Sasha knows that Teodor likes to show off so he never trusts him.       Teodor wants to prove that he can be trusted sometimes, so he       decided to convince Sasha that there is no such integer point in       his picture, which belongs to each segment. However Teodor is lazy       person and neither wills to tell Sasha all coordinates of       segments' ends nor wills to tell him their amount, so he suggested       Sasha to ask him series of questions 'Given the integer point          x  i, how many segments in Fedya's picture       contain that point?', promising to tell correct answers for this questions.

931,"Anya and Kirill are doing a physics laboratory work. In one of       the tasks they have to measure some value  n times, and then compute the average value to       lower the error.

944,"In Arcady's garden there grows a peculiar apple-tree that fruits       one time per year. Its peculiarity can be explained in following       way: there are  n inflorescences, numbered from 1 to  n. Inflorescence number 1 is situated near base of tree and any       other inflorescence with number  i ( i > 1) is situated at the top of branch, which       bottom is  p  i-th inflorescence and  p  i < i. Once tree starts fruiting, there appears exactly one apple in       each inflorescence. The same moment as apples appear, they start       to roll down along branches to the very base of tree. Each second       all apples, except ones in first inflorescence simultaneously roll       down one branch closer to tree base, e.g. apple in  a-th inflorescence gets to  p  a-th inflorescence. Apples that end up in       first inflorescence are gathered by Arcady in exactly the same       moment. Second peculiarity of this tree is that once two apples       are in same inflorescence they annihilate. This happens with       each pair of apples, e.g. if there are 5 apples in same inflorescence in same       time, only one will not be annihilated and if there are 8 apples, all apples will be annihilated.       Thus, there can be no more than one apple in each inflorescence in       each moment of time. Help Arcady with counting number of apples he will be able to       collect from first inflorescence during one harvest.","First line of input contains single integer number  n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100 000)  — number of inflorescences.

In the second example Arcady will be able to collect 3 apples.       First one is one initially situated in first inflorescence. In a       second apple from 2nd inflorescence       will roll down to 1st (Arcady will       collect it) and apples from 3rd,         4th, 5th inflorescences will roll down to 2nd. Two of them will annihilate and one       not annihilated will roll down from 2-nd inflorescence to 1st one in the next second and Arcady will       collect it."

947,"Alice has a very important message  M consisting of some non-negative integers that       she wants to keep secret from Eve. Alice knows that the only       theoretically secure cipher is one-time pad. Alice generates a       random key  K of the length equal to the message's length.       Alice computes the bitwise xor of each element of the message and       the key (,       where        denotes the bitwise         XOR operation) and stores this encrypted message  A. Alice is smart. Be like Alice. For example, Alice may have wanted to store a message  M = (0, 15, 9, 18). She generated a key  K = (16, 7, 6, 3). The encrypted message is thus          A = (16, 8, 15, 17). Alice realised that she cannot store the key with the encrypted       message. Alice sent her key  K to Bob and deleted her own copy. Alice is smart.       Really, be like Alice. Bob realised that the encrypted message is only secure as long as       the key is secret. Bob thus randomly permuted the key before       storing it.

949,"BigData Inc. is a corporation that has  n data centers indexed from 1 to  n that are located all over the world. These data       centers provide storage for client data (you can figure out that       client data is really big!). Main feature of services offered by BigData Inc. is the access       availability guarantee even under the circumstances of any data       center having an outage. Such a guarantee is ensured by using the         two-way replication.       Two-way replication is such an approach for data storage that any       piece of data is represented by two identical copies that are       stored in two different data centers. For each of  m company clients, let us denote indices of two       different data centers storing this client data as  c  i, 1 and  c  i, 2. In order to keep data centers operational and safe, the software       running on data center computers is being updated regularly.       Release cycle of BigData Inc. is one day meaning that the new       version of software is being deployed to the data center computers       each day. Data center software update is a non-trivial long process, that       is why there is a special hour-long time frame that is dedicated       for data center maintenance. During the maintenance period, data       center computers are installing software updates, and thus they       may be unavailable. Consider the day to be exactly  h hours long. For each data center there is an       integer  u  j (0 ≤ u  j ≤ h - 1) defining the index of an       hour of day, such that during this hour data center  j is unavailable due to maintenance. Summing up everything above, the condition  u  c  i, 1 ≠ u  c  i, 2 should hold for each client,       or otherwise his data may be unaccessible while data centers that       store it are under maintenance. Due to occasional timezone change in different cities all over       the world, the maintenance time in some of the data centers may       change by one hour sometimes. Company should be prepared for such       situation, that is why they decided to conduct an experiment,       choosing some non-empty subset of data centers, and shifting the       maintenance time for them by an hour later (i.e. if  u  j = h - 1, then the new maintenance       hour would become 0, otherwise it       would become  u  j + 1). Nonetheless, such an experiment       should not break the accessibility guarantees, meaning that data       of any client should be still available during any hour of a day       after the data center maintenance times are changed. Such an experiment would provide useful insights, but changing       update time is quite an expensive procedure, that is why the       company asked you to find out the minimum number of data centers       that have to be included in an experiment in order to keep the       data accessibility guarantees.","The first line of input contains three integers  n,  m and  h (2 ≤ n ≤ 100 000, 1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000, 2 ≤ h ≤ 100 000), the number of       company data centers, number of clients and the day length of day       measured in hours.

Their algorithm will be tested on an array of integers, where the       ii-th integer represents the color of the ii-th pixel in       the image. The image is in black and white, therefore the color of       each pixel will be an integer between 0 and 255 (inclusive). To implement the filter, students are required to divide the       black and white color range [0, 255] into groups of consecutive       colors, and select one color in each group to be the group’s key.       In order to preserve image details, the size of a group must not       be greater than kk, and each color should belong to exactly       one group. Finally, the students will replace the color of each pixel in the       array with that color’s assigned group key.

After that, in the morning he eats kk candies from the       box (if there are less than kk candies in the box, he eats       them all), then in the evening Petya eats 10%10% of the       candies remaining in the       box. If there are still candies left in the box, the process       repeats — next day Vasya eats kk candies again, and Petya —       10%10% of the candies left in a box, and so on. If the amount of candies in the box is not divisible by 1010,       Petya rounds the amount he takes from the box down. For example,       if there were 9797 candies in the box, Petya would eat only       99 of them. In particular, if there are less than 1010       candies in a box, Petya won't eat any at all. Your task is to find out the minimal amount of kk that can       be chosen by Vasya so that he would eat at least half of the       nn candies he initially got. Note that the number kk       must be integer.",The first line contains a single integer nn (1≤n≤10181≤n≤1018) — the initial amount of candies in the box.,Output a single integer — the minimal amount of kk that       would allow Vasya to eat at least half of candies he got.,"In the sample, the amount of candies, with k=3k=3, would       change in the following way (Vasya eats first): 68→65→59→56→51→48→44→41→37→34→31→28→26→23→21→18→17→14→13→10→9→6→6→3→3→068→65→59→56→51→48→44→41→37→34→31→28→26→23→21→18→17→14→13→10→9→6→6→3→3→0. In total, Vasya would eat 3939 candies, while Petya — 2929."
992,"Nastya received a gift on New Year — a magic wardrobe. It is       magic because in the end of each month the number of dresses in it       doubles (i.e. the number of dresses becomes twice as large as it       is in the beginning of the month). Unfortunately, right after the doubling the wardrobe eats one of       the dresses (if any) with the 50%       probability. It happens every month except the last one in the       year.  Nastya owns  x dresses now, so she became interested in the expected       number of dresses she will have in one year. Nastya lives in       Byteland, so the year lasts for  k + 1 months. Nastya is really busy, so she wants you to solve this problem.       You are the programmer, after all. Also, you should find the       answer modulo 109 + 7, because it is easy to see       that it is always integer.","The only line contains two integers  x and  k (0 ≤ x, k ≤ 1018), where  x is the initial number of dresses and  k + 1 is the number of months in a year in Byteland.",In the only line print a single integer — the expected number of       dresses Nastya will own one year later modulo 109 + 7.,"In the first example a year consists on only one month, so the       wardrobe does not eat dresses at all. In the second example after the first month there are 3 dresses with 50% probability and 4 dresses with 50% probability. Thus, in the end of the       year there are 6 dresses with 50% probability and 8 dresses with 50% probability. This way the answer for       this test is (6 + 8) / 2 = 7."

996,"Allen dreams of one day owning a enormous fleet of electric cars,       the car of the future! He knows that this will give him a big       status boost. As Allen is planning out all of the different types       of cars he will own and how he will arrange them, he realizes that       he has a problem.  Allen's future parking lot can be represented as a rectangle with       44 rows and nn (n≤50n≤50) columns of rectangular       spaces, each of which can contain at most one car at any time. He       imagines having kk (k≤2nk≤2n) cars in the grid, and all       the cars are initially in the second and third rows. Each of the       cars also has a different designated parking space in the first or       fourth row. Allen has to put the cars into corresponding parking places. However, since Allen would never entrust his cars to anyone else,       only one car can be moved at a time. He can drive a car from a       space in any of the four cardinal directions to a neighboring       empty space. Furthermore, Allen can only move one of his cars into       a space on the first or fourth rows if it is the car's designated       parking space.
