1,"Theatre Square in the capital city of Berland has a rectangular       shape with the size  n × m meters. On the occasion of the city's       anniversary, a decision was taken to pave the Square with square       granite flagstones. Each flagstone is of the size  a × a. What is the least number of flagstones needed to pave the Square?       It's allowed to cover the surface larger than the Theatre Square,       but the Square has to be covered. It's not allowed to break the       flagstones.

2,"The winner of the card game popular in Berland       ""Berlogging"" is determined according to the following       rules. If at the end of the game there is only one player with the       maximum number of points, he is the winner. The situation becomes       more difficult if the number of such players is more than one.       During each round a player gains or loses a particular number of       points. In the course of the game the number of points is       registered in the line ""name       score"", where name is a player's name, and         score is the number of       points gained in this round, which is an integer number. If score       is negative, this means that the player has lost in the round. So,       if two or more players have the maximum number of points (say, it       equals to  m) at the end of the game, than wins the one of them who scored at least          m points first. Initially each player has 0       points. It's guaranteed that at the end of the game at least one       player has a positive number of points.","The first line contains an integer number  n (1  ≤  n  ≤  1000),  n is the number of rounds played.

7,"A famous Berland's painter Kalevitch likes to shock the public.       One of his last obsessions is chess. For more than a thousand       years people have been playing this old game on uninteresting,       monotonous boards. Kalevitch decided to put an end to this       tradition and to introduce a new attitude to chessboards. As before, the chessboard is a square-checkered board with the       squares arranged in a 8 × 8 grid,       each square is painted black or white. Kalevitch suggests that       chessboards should be painted in the following manner: there       should be chosen a horizontal or a vertical line of 8 squares       (i.e. a row or a column), and painted black. Initially the whole       chessboard is white, and it can be painted in the above described       way one or more times. It is allowed to paint a square many times,       but after the first time it does not change its colour any more       and remains black. Kalevitch paints chessboards neatly, and it is       impossible to judge by an individual square if it was painted with       a vertical or a horizontal stroke. Kalevitch hopes that such chessboards will gain popularity, and       he will be commissioned to paint chessboards, which will help him       ensure a comfortable old age. The clients will inform him what       chessboard they want to have, and the painter will paint a white       chessboard meeting the client's requirements. It goes without saying that in such business one should economize       on everything — for each commission he wants to know the minimum       amount of strokes that he has to paint to fulfill the client's       needs. You are asked to help Kalevitch with this task.","The input file contains 8 lines, each of the lines contains 8       characters. The given matrix describes the client's requirements,         W character stands for a       white square, and B       character — for a square painted black. It is guaranteed that client's requirments can be fulfilled with       a sequence of allowed strokes (vertical/column or horizontal/row).",Output the only number — the minimum amount of rows and columns       that Kalevitch has to paint on the white chessboard to meet the       client's requirements.,

The boy started to memorize the order of the flags' colours that       he had seen. But soon he fell asleep again. Unfortunately, he       didn't sleep long, he woke up and went on memorizing the colours.       Then he fell asleep again, and that time he slept till the end of       the journey.

One of Valerie's       distinguishing features is that while eating one crucian she uses       only one row of her teeth, the rest of the teeth are ""relaxing"". For a long time our heroine had been searching the sea for       crucians, but a great misfortune happened. Her teeth started to       ache, and she had to see the local dentist, lobster Ashot. As a       professional, Ashot quickly relieved Valerie from her toothache.       Moreover, he managed to determine the cause of Valerie's       developing caries (for what he was later nicknamed Cap). It turned that Valerie eats too many crucians. To help Valerie       avoid further reoccurrence of toothache, Ashot found for each       Valerie's tooth its residual viability. Residual viability of a       tooth is a value equal to the amount of crucians that Valerie can       eat with this tooth. Every time Valerie eats a crucian, viability       of all the teeth used for it will decrease by one. When the       viability of at least one tooth becomes negative, the shark will       have to see the dentist again.  Unhappy, Valerie came back home, where a portion of crucians was       waiting for her.

39,"C*++ language is quite similar to C++. The similarity manifests       itself in the fact that the programs written in C*++ sometimes       behave unpredictably and lead to absolutely unexpected effects.

Thus, we have a sum consisting of several summands divided by       signs ""+"" or         ""-"". Every       summand is an expression ""a++"" or ""++a"" multiplied by some       integer coefficient. If the coefficient is omitted, it is       suggested being equal to 1. The calculation of such sum in C*++ goes the following way. First       all the summands are calculated one after another, then they are       summed by the usual arithmetic rules. If the summand contains         ""a++"", then       during the calculation first the value of the ""a"" variable is multiplied by       the coefficient, then value of ""a"" is increased by 1. If the summand contains ""++a"", then the actions on it       are performed in the reverse order: first ""a"" is increased by 1, then — multiplied by the coefficient.

46,"A kindergarten teacher Natalia Pavlovna has invented a new ball       game. This game not only develops the children's physique, but       also teaches them how to count.  The game goes as follows. Kids stand in circle. Let's agree to       think of the children as numbered with numbers from 1 to  n clockwise and the child number 1 is holding the ball. First the first       child throws the ball to the next one clockwise, i.e. to the child       number 2. Then the child number         2 throws the ball to the next but       one child, i.e. to the child number 4, then the fourth child throws the ball       to the child that stands two children away from him, i.e. to the       child number 7, then the ball is       thrown to the child who stands 3       children away from the child number 7, then the ball is thrown to the child       who stands 4 children away from the       last one, and so on. It should be mentioned that when a ball is       thrown it may pass the beginning of the circle. For example, if          n = 5, then after the third throw the child number         2 has the ball again. Overall,          n - 1 throws are made, and the game ends. The problem is that not all the children get the ball during the       game. If a child doesn't get the ball, he gets very upset and       cries until Natalia Pavlovna gives him a candy. That's why Natalia       Pavlovna asks you to help her to identify the numbers of the       children who will get the ball after each throw.",The first line contains integer  n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) which indicates the       number of kids in the circle.,In the single line print  n - 1 numbers which are the numbers of children       who will get the ball after each throw.

Everybody got relieved but then yet another       burning problem popped up — who will play first? This time       Matroskin came up with a brilliant solution, suggesting the most       fair way to find it out: play rock-paper-scissors together. The       rules of the game are very simple. On the count of three every       player shows a combination with his hand (or paw). The combination       corresponds to one of three things: a rock, scissors or paper.       Some of the gestures win over some other ones according to       well-known rules: the rock breaks the scissors, the scissors cut       the paper, and the paper gets wrapped over the stone. Usually       there are two players. Yet there are three friends, that’s why       they decided to choose the winner like that: If someone shows the       gesture that wins over the other two players, then that player       wins.

The first one       allows you to convert  a grams of sand into  b grams of lead, the second one allows you to       convert  c grams of lead into  d grams of gold and third one allows you to       convert  e grams of gold into  f grams of sand. When Harry told his friends about       these spells, Ron Weasley was amazed. After all, if they succeed       in turning sand into lead, lead into gold, and then turning part       of the gold into sand again and so on, then it will be possible to       start with a small amount of sand and get huge amounts of gold!       Even an infinite amount of gold! Hermione Granger, by contrast,       was skeptical about that idea. She argues that according to the       law of conservation of matter getting an infinite amount of       matter, even using magic, is impossible. On the contrary, the       amount of matter may even decrease during transformation, being       converted to magical energy. Though Hermione's theory seems       convincing, Ron won't believe her. As far as Ron is concerned,       Hermione made up her law of conservation of matter to stop Harry       and Ron wasting their time with this nonsense, and to make them go       and do homework instead. That's why Ron has already collected a       certain amount of sand for the experiments. A quarrel between the       friends seems unavoidable... Help Harry to determine which one of his friends is right, and       avoid the quarrel after all. To do this you have to figure out       whether it is possible to get the amount of gold greater than any       preassigned number from some finite amount of sand.","The first line contains 6 integers          a,  b,  c,  d,  e,  f (0 ≤ a, b, c, d, e, f ≤ 1000).","Print ""Ron"", if it is possible to get an infinitely       large amount of gold having a certain finite amount of sand (and       not having any gold and lead at all), i.e., Ron is right.       Otherwise, print ""Hermione"".","Consider the first sample. Let's start with the 500 grams of sand. Apply the first spell         5 times and turn the sand into         1000 grams of lead. Then apply the       second spell 4 times to get 600 grams of gold. Let’s take 400 grams from the resulting amount of       gold turn them back into sand. We get 500 grams of sand and 200 grams of gold. If we apply the same       operations to 500 grams of sand       again, we can get extra 200 grams of       gold every time. Thus, you can get 200, 400,         600 etc. grams of gold, i.e.,       starting with a finite amount of sand (500 grams), you can get the amount of gold       which is greater than any preassigned number. In the forth sample it is impossible to get sand, or lead, or       gold, applying the spells. In the fifth sample an infinitely large amount of gold can be       obtained by using only the second spell, which allows you to       receive 1 gram of gold out of       nothing. Note that if such a second spell is available, then the       first and the third one do not affect the answer at all. The seventh sample is more interesting. We can also start with a       zero amount of sand there. With the aid of the third spell you can       get sand out of nothing. We get 10000 grams of sand in this manner. Let's       get 100 grams of lead using the       first spell 100 times. Then make         1 gram of gold from them. We       managed to receive 1 gram of gold,       starting with a zero amount of sand! Clearly, in this manner you       can get an infinitely large amount of gold."

But having attended several classes of the club, Petya realized       that not all tasks require using the BigInteger type. It turned       out that in some tasks it is much easier to use small data types.       That's why a question arises: ""Which integer type to use if       one wants to store a positive integer  n?"" Petya knows only 5 integer types: 1) byte occupies 1 byte       and allows you to store numbers from  - 128 to 127 2) short occupies 2 bytes       and allows you to store numbers from  - 32768 to 32767 3) int occupies 4 bytes       and allows you to store numbers from  - 2147483648 to 2147483647 4) long occupies 8 bytes       and allows you to store numbers from  - 9223372036854775808 to 9223372036854775807 5) BigInteger can store       any integer number, but at that it is not a primitive type, and       operations with it are much slower. For all the types given above the boundary values are included in       the value range. From this list, Petya wants to choose the smallest type that can       store a positive integer  n.

His task is to       count the number of integers  x in range [a;b] with property  f(x) = x.

For example,       instead of the phrase ""how are you"" he can type       ""hhoow aaaare yyoouu"".  Polycarp decided to automate the process of correcting such       errors. He decided to write a plug-in to the text editor that will       remove pairs of identical consecutive letters (if there are any in       the text). Of course, this is not exactly what Polycarp needs, but       he's got to start from something!  Help Polycarp and write the main plug-in module. Your program       should remove from a string all pairs of identical letters, which       are consecutive. If after the removal there appear new pairs, the       program should remove them as well.

Valera absolutely accidentally got a piece of ancient parchment       on which an array of numbers was written. He immediately thought       that the numbers in this array were not random. As a result of       extensive research Valera worked out a wonderful property that a       magical array should have: an array is defined as magic if its         minimum and maximum coincide. He decided to share this outstanding discovery with you, but he       asks you for help in return. Despite the tremendous intelligence       and wit, Valera counts very badly and so you will have to complete       his work.

The current player specifies       for each of her soldiers an enemy's soldier he will shoot (a       target) and then all the player's soldiers shot simultaneously.

86,"For each positive integer  n consider the integer ψ(n) which is obtained from  n by replacing every digit  a in the decimal notation of  n with the digit (9  -  a). We say that ψ(n) is the reflection of  n. For example, reflection of 192 equals 807. Note that leading zeros (if any)       should be omitted. So reflection of 9 equals 0,       reflection of 91 equals 8. Let us call the weight of       the number the product of the number and its reflection. Thus, the       weight of the number 10 is equal to         10·89 = 890.

87,"Vasya the programmer lives in the middle of the Programming       subway branch. He has two girlfriends: Dasha and Masha, who live       at the different ends of the branch, each one is unaware of the       other one's existence. When Vasya has some free time, he goes to one of his girlfriends.       He descends into the subway at some time, waits the first train to       come and rides on it to the end of the branch to the corresponding       girl. However, the trains run with different frequencies: a train       goes to Dasha's direction every  a minutes, but a train goes to Masha's direction       every  b minutes. If two trains approach at the same       time, Vasya goes toward the direction with the lower frequency of       going trains, that is, to the girl, to whose directions the trains       go less frequently (see the note to the third sample). We know that the trains begin to go simultaneously before Vasya       appears. That is the train schedule is such that there exists a       moment of time when the two trains arrive simultaneously. Help Vasya count to which girlfriend he will go more often.","The first line contains two integers  a and  b ( a ≠ b, 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 106).","Print ""Dasha"" if       Vasya will go to Dasha more frequently, ""Masha"" if he will go to       Masha more frequently, or ""Equal"" if he will go to both       girlfriends with the same frequency.","Let's take a look at the third sample. Let the trains start to go       at the zero moment of time. It is clear that the moments of the       trains' arrival will be periodic with period 6. That's why it is       enough to show that if Vasya descends to the subway at a moment of       time inside the interval (0, 6], he       will go to both girls equally often.  If he descends to the subway at a moment of time from 0 to 2, he       leaves for Dasha on the train that arrives by the second minute. If he descends to the subway at a moment of time from 2 to 3, he       leaves for Masha on the train that arrives by the third minute. If he descends to the subway at a moment of time from 3 to 4, he       leaves for Dasha on the train that arrives by the fourth minute. If he descends to the subway at a moment of time from 4 to 6, he       waits for both trains to arrive by the sixth minute and goes to       Masha as trains go less often in Masha's direction. In sum Masha and Dasha get equal time — three minutes for each       one, thus, Vasya will go to both girlfriends equally often."
88,"Vasya studies music.  He has learned lots of interesting stuff. For example, he knows       that there are 12 notes: C,         C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes       are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and       the C note after the H similar and we will identify       them with each other. The distance between the notes along the       musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes       there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is       taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the       distance between C and         E is 4 semitones and       between E and C is 8 semitones Vasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of       no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with       triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three       notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads —       major and minor. Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes  X,  Y and  Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance       along the musical scale between  X and  Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between          Y and  Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The       distance between  X and  Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones. A minor triad is different in that the distance between  X and  Y should be 3 semitones and between  Y and  Z — 4 semitones. For example, the triad ""C E       G"" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between         E and G are 3 semitones. And the       triplet ""C# B F""       is minor, because if we order the notes as ""B C# F"", than between         B and C# will be 3 semitones, and       between C# and F — 4 semitones. Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.",The only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.,"Print ""major"" if       the chord is major, ""minor"" if it is minor, and         ""strange"" if       the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor       minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be       unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and       minor simultaneously.",

As a       result of this check we get an  n - 1 sums. If at least one of the sums differs       from the corresponding sum received during the previous check,       then the security system is triggered. Joe can move the diamonds from one cell to another between the       security system's checks. He manages to move them no more than          m times between two checks.

Thus, Petya was given the original       team name  w and the collection of forbidden substrings  s 1, s 2, ..., s  n. All those strings consist of uppercase       and lowercase Latin letters. String  w has the length of |w|, its characters are numbered       from 1 to |w|. First Petya should find all the occurrences of forbidden       substrings in the  w string.

After that Petya should perform the replacement of all letters       covered by the occurrences.

In Mainframe a standard pack of 52       cards is used to play blackjack. The pack contains cards of 13 values: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, jacks, queens, kings and aces. Each       value also exists in one of four suits: hearts, diamonds, clubs       and spades.

An ace can either earn 1 or 11,       whatever the player wishes. The picture cards (king, queen and       jack) earn 10 points. The number of       points a card earns does not depend on the suit. The rules of the       game are very simple. The player gets two cards, if the sum of       points of those cards equals  n, then the player wins, otherwise the player loses. The player has already got the first card, it's the queen of       spades.

105,"In Disgaea as in most role-playing games, characters have skills       that determine the character's ability to use certain weapons or       spells. If the character does not have the necessary skill, he       cannot use it. The skill level is represented as an integer that       increases when you use this skill. Different character classes are       characterized by different skills.  Unfortunately, the skills that are uncommon for the given       character's class are quite difficult to obtain. To avoid this       limitation, there is the so-called transmigration.  Transmigration is reincarnation of the character in a new       creature. His soul shifts to a new body and retains part of his       experience from the previous life.  As a result of transmigration the new character gets all the       skills of the old character and the skill levels are reduced       according to the  k coefficient (if the skill level was equal to          x, then after transmigration it becomes equal to         [kx], where [y] is the integral part of  y). If some skill's levels are strictly less than 100, these skills are forgotten (the       character does not have them any more). After that the new       character also gains the skills that are specific for his class,       but are new to him. The levels of those additional skills are set       to 0.  Thus, one can create a character with skills specific for       completely different character classes via transmigrations. For       example, creating a mage archer or a thief warrior is possible.

138,"Vera adores poems. All the poems Vera knows are divided into       quatrains (groups of four lines) and in each quatrain some lines       contain rhymes. Let's consider that all lines in the poems consist of lowercase       Latin letters (without spaces). Letters ""a"", ""e"", ""i"", ""o"", ""u"" are considered vowels. Two lines rhyme if their suffixes that start from the  k-th vowels (counting from the end) match. If a       line has less than  k vowels, then such line can't rhyme with any       other line. For example, if  k = 1, lines  commit and  hermit rhyme (the corresponding suffixes equal          it), and if  k = 2, they do not rhyme ( ommit ≠ ermit). Today on a literature lesson Vera learned that quatrains can       contain four different schemes of rhymes, namely the following       ones (the same letters stand for rhyming lines):  If all lines of a quatrain pairwise rhyme, then the quatrain can       belong to any rhyme scheme (this situation is represented by  aaaa). If all quatrains of a poem belong to the same rhyme scheme, then       we can assume that the whole poem belongs to this rhyme scheme. If       in each quatrain all lines pairwise rhyme, then the rhyme scheme       of the poem is  aaaa. Let us note that it doesn't matter whether       lines from different quatrains rhyme with each other or not. In       other words, it is possible that different quatrains aren't       connected by a rhyme. Vera got a long poem as a home task. The girl has to analyse it       and find the poem rhyme scheme. Help Vera cope with the task.","The first line contains two integers  n and  k (1 ≤ n ≤ 2500, 1 ≤ k ≤ 5) — the number of       quatrains in the poem and the vowel's number, correspondingly.       Next 4n lines contain the       poem. Each line is not empty and only consists of small Latin       letters. The total length of the lines does not exceed 104. If we assume that the lines are numbered starting from 1, then       the first quatrain contains lines number 1, 2, 3, 4; the       second one contains lines number 5,         6, 7, 8; and so on.","Print the rhyme scheme of the poem as ""aabb"", ""abab"", ""abba"", ""aaaa""; or ""NO"" if the poem does not       belong to any of the above mentioned schemes.","In the last sample both quatrains have rhymes but finding the       common scheme is impossible, so the answer is ""NO""."

Sam would spend the whole summer stocking hay to feed Dawn in       winter. Sam scythed hay and put it into haystack. As Sam was a       bright farmer, he tried to make the process of storing hay simpler       and more convenient to use. He collected the hay into cubical hay       blocks of the same size. Then he stored the blocks in his barn.       After a summer spent in hard toil Sam stored  A·B·C hay blocks and stored them in       a barn as a rectangular parallelepiped  A layers high. Each layer had  B rows and each row had  C blocks. At the end of the autumn Sam came into the barn to admire one       more time the hay he'd been stacking during this hard summer.       Unfortunately, Sam was horrified to see that the hay blocks had       been carelessly scattered around the barn. The place was a       complete mess. As it turned out, thieves had sneaked into the       barn. They completely dissembled and took away a layer of blocks       from the parallelepiped's front, back, top and sides. As a result,       the barn only had a parallelepiped containing (A - 1) × (B - 2) × (C - 2)       hay blocks.

If initially Sam has a       parallelepiped consisting of 32 = 2 × 4 × 4 hay blocks in his barn,       then after the theft the barn has 4 = (2 - 1) × (4 - 2) × (4 - 2) hay blocks       left. Thus, the thieves could have stolen 32 - 4 = 28 hay blocks.

Sentences of the  N-ish language can be represented as strings       consisting of lowercase Latin letters without spaces or       punctuation marks. Sergey totally forgot about the task until half an hour before       the next lesson and hastily scribbled something down. But then he       recollected that in the last lesson he learned the grammar of          N-ish. The spelling rules state that  N-ish contains some ""forbidden"" pairs of       letters: such letters can never occur in a sentence next to each       other. Also, the order of the letters doesn't matter (for example,       if the pair of letters ""ab"" is forbidden, then any       occurrences of substrings ""ab"" and ""ba"" are also forbidden).       Also, each pair has different letters and each letter occurs in no       more than one forbidden pair.

She fished in the purse and found some number of coins,       or to be exact,  n coins of arbitrary values  a 1, a 2, ..., a  n. But as Mom was running out of time, she       didn't split the coins for you two. So she scribbled a note asking       you to split the money equally.

However,       you correctly thought that if you take too many coins, the twin       will suspect the deception.

167,"In some country live wizards. They love to ride trolleybuses. A city in this country has a trolleybus depot with  n trolleybuses. Every day the trolleybuses leave       the depot, one by one and go to the final station. The final       station is at a distance of  d meters from the depot. We know for the  i-th trolleybus that it leaves at the moment of       time  t  i seconds, can go at a speed of no greater       than  v  i meters per second, and accelerate with       an acceleration no greater than  a meters per second squared. A trolleybus can       decelerate as quickly as you want (magic!). It can change its       acceleration as fast as you want, as well. Note that the maximum       acceleration is the same for all trolleys. Despite the magic the trolleys are still powered by an electric       circuit and cannot overtake each other (the wires are to blame, of       course). If a trolleybus catches up with another one, they go       together one right after the other until they arrive at the final       station. Also, the drivers are driving so as to arrive at the       final station as quickly as possible. You, as head of the trolleybuses' fans' club, are to determine       for each trolley the minimum time by which it can reach the final       station. At the time of arrival at the destination station the       trolleybus does not necessarily have zero speed. When a trolley is       leaving the depot, its speed is considered equal to zero. From the       point of view of physics, the trolleybuses can be considered as       material points, and also we should ignore the impact on the speed       of a trolley bus by everything, except for the acceleration and       deceleration provided by the engine.","The first input line contains three space-separated integers          n,  a,  d (1 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ a, d ≤ 106) — the number of trolleybuses,       their maximum acceleration and the distance from the depot to the       final station, correspondingly.

The trolleybuses will go the remaining 9489.5 meters       together at speed 10 meters per second. As a result, both       trolleybuses will arrive to the final station by the moment of       time 1000.5 seconds. The third trolleybus will not catch up with       them.

229,"You are given a table consisting of  n rows and  m columns. Each cell of the table contains a       number, 0 or 1. In one move we can choose some row of the table       and cyclically shift its values either one cell to the left, or       one cell to the right. To cyclically shift       a table row one cell to the right means to move the value of each       cell, except for the last one, to the right neighboring cell, and       to move the value of the last cell to the first cell. A cyclical       shift of a row to the left is performed similarly, but in the       other direction. For example, if we cyclically shift a row         ""00110"" one       cell to the right, we get a row ""00011"", but if we shift a       row ""00110"" one       cell to the left, we get a row ""01100"".

245,"Polycarpus is a system administrator. There are two servers under       his strict guidance —  a and  b. To stay informed about the servers'       performance, Polycarpus executes commands ""ping a"" and ""ping b"". Each ping command       sends exactly ten packets to the server specified in the argument       of the command. Executing a program results in two integers  x and  y (x + y = 10; x, y ≥ 0).       These numbers mean that  x packets successfully reached the corresponding       server through the network and  y packets were lost. Today Polycarpus has performed overall  n ping commands during his workday. Now for each       server Polycarpus wants to know whether the server is       ""alive"" or not.

Karlsson was       not going to be hungry any longer, so he decided to get some food       in the house. Karlsson's gaze immediately fell on  n wooden cupboards, standing in the kitchen. He       immediately realized that these cupboards have hidden jam stocks.       Karlsson began to fly greedily around the kitchen, opening and       closing the cupboards' doors, grab and empty all the jars of jam       that he could find. And now all jars of jam are empty, Karlsson has had enough and       does not want to leave traces of his stay, so as not to let down       his friend. Each of the cupboards has two doors: the left one and       the right one. Karlsson remembers that when he rushed to the       kitchen, all the cupboards' left doors were in the same position       (open or closed), similarly, all the cupboards' right doors were       in the same position (open or closed). Karlsson wants the doors to       meet this condition as well by the time the family returns.       Karlsson does not remember the position of all the left doors,       also, he cannot remember the position of all the right doors.       Therefore, it does not matter to him in what position will be all       left or right doors. It is important to leave all the left doors       in the same position, and all the right doors in the same       position. For example, all the left doors may be closed, and all       the right ones may be open. Karlsson needs one second to open or close a door of a cupboard.

250,"Polycarpus has been working in the analytic department of the       ""F.R.A.U.D."" company for as much as  n days. Right now his task is to make a series of       reports about the company's performance for the last  n days. We know that the main information in a day       report is value  a  i, the company's profit on the  i-th day. If  a  i is negative, then the company suffered       losses on the  i-th day.

To do this, they have a large (and a very       heavy) ladder which was put exactly opposite the  k-th square of the poster. To draw the  i-th character of the slogan on the poster, you       need to climb the ladder, standing in front of the  i-th square of the poster. This action (along with       climbing up and down the ladder) takes one hour for a painter. The       painter is not allowed to draw characters in the adjacent squares       when the ladder is in front of the  i-th square because the uncomfortable position of       the ladder may make the characters untidy. Besides, the       programmers can move the ladder. In one hour, they can move the       ladder either a meter to the right or a meter to the left.

Right after someone has picked node  x, the value of node  x flips, the values of sons of  x remain the same, the values of sons of sons of          x flips, the values of sons of sons of sons of          x remain the same and so on.

Today Mike decided to cover the track with holds hanging on       heights  a 1, ...,  a  n. To make the problem harder, Mike       decided to remove one hold, that is, remove one element of the       sequence (for example, if we take the sequence (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) and remove the third       element from it, we obtain the sequence (1, 2, 4, 5)). However, as Mike is awful       at climbing, he wants the final difficulty (i.e. the maximum       difference of heights between adjacent holds after removing the       hold) to be as small as possible among all possible options of       removing a hold. The first and last holds must stay at their positions. Help Mike determine the minimum difficulty of the track after       removing one hold.","The first line contains a single integer  n (3 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of holds. The next line contains  n space-separated integers  a  i (1 ≤ a  i ≤ 1000), where  a  i is the height where the hold number          i hangs. The sequence  a  i is increasing (i.e. each element except       for the first one is strictly larger than the previous one).",Print a single number — the minimum difficulty of the track after       removing a single hold.,"In the first sample you can remove only the second hold, then the       sequence looks like (1, 6), the       maximum difference of the neighboring elements equals 5. In the second test after removing every hold the difficulty       equals 2. In the third test you can obtain sequences (1, 3, 7, 8), (1, 2, 7, 8), (1, 2, 3, 8), for which the difficulty is       4, 5 and 5, respectively. Thus, after removing the second element       we obtain the optimal answer — 4."

525,"After a hard day Vitaly got very hungry and he wants to eat his       favorite potato pie. But it's not that simple. Vitaly is in the       first room of the house with  n room located in a line and numbered starting       from one from left to right. You can go from the first room to the       second room, from the second room to the third room and so on —       you can go from the ( n - 1)-th room to the  n-th room. Thus, you can go to room  x only from room  x - 1. The potato pie is located in the  n-th room and Vitaly needs to go there.  Each pair of consecutive rooms has a door between them. In order       to go to room  x from room  x - 1, you need to open the door between the rooms       with the corresponding key.  In total the house has several types of doors (represented by       uppercase Latin letters) and several types of keys (represented by       lowercase Latin letters). The key of type  t can open the door of type  T if and only if  t and  T are the same letter, written in different cases.       For example, key f can open       door F. Each of the first  n - 1 rooms contains exactly one key of some type       that Vitaly can use to get to next rooms. Once the door is open       with some key, Vitaly won't get the key from the keyhole but he       will immediately run into the next room. In other words, each key       can open no more than one door. Vitaly realizes that he may end up in some room without the key       that opens the door to the next room. Before the start his run for       the potato pie Vitaly can buy any number of keys of any type that       is guaranteed to get to room  n. Given the plan of the house, Vitaly wants to know what is the       minimum number of keys he needs to buy to surely get to the room          n, which has a delicious potato pie. Write a       program that will help Vitaly find out this number.","The first line of the input contains a positive integer  n (2 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of rooms in the house.

526," In this problem you will meet the         simplified model of game King of Thieves. In a new ZeptoLab game called ""King of Thieves"" your       aim is to reach a chest with gold by controlling your character,       avoiding traps and obstacles on your way. An interesting feature of the game is that you can design your       own levels that will be available to other players. Let's consider       the following simple design of a level. A dungeon consists of  n segments located at a same vertical level, each       segment is either a platform that character can stand on, or a pit       with a trap that makes player lose if he falls into it. All       segments have the same length, platforms on the scheme of the       level are represented as '*' and pits are represented as         '.'.  One of things that affects speedrun characteristics of the level       is a possibility to perform a series of consecutive jumps of the       same length. More formally, when the character is on the platform       number  i 1, he can make a sequence       of jumps through the platforms  i 1 < i 2 < ... < i  k, if  i 2 - i 1 = i 3 - i 2 = ... = i  k - i  k - 1. Of course, all segments  i 1, i 2, ... i  k should be exactly the platforms, not       pits.  Let's call a level to be good if you can perform a       sequence of four jumps of       the same length or in the other words there must be a sequence          i 1, i 2, ..., i 5, consisting of five platforms so that the       intervals between consecutive platforms are of the same length.

They also decided that there must be given at least  min 1 and at most  max 1 diplomas of the first       degree, at least  min 2 and at most  max 2 diplomas of the second       degree, and at least  min 3 and at most  max 3 diplomas of the third degree. After some discussion it was decided to choose from all the       options of distributing diplomas satisfying these limitations the       one that maximizes the number of participants who receive diplomas       of the first degree. Of all these options they select the one       which maximizes the number of the participants who receive       diplomas of the second degree. If there are multiple of these       options, they select the option that maximizes the number of       diplomas of the third degree. Choosing the best option of distributing certificates was       entrusted to Ilya, one of the best programmers of Berland.       However, he found more important things to do, so it is your task       now to choose the best option of distributing of diplomas, based       on the described limitations.

The optimal variant of distributing diplomas is the one that       maximizes the number of students who receive diplomas of the first       degree. Of all the suitable options, the best one is the one which       maximizes the number of participants who receive diplomas of the       second degree. If there are several of these options, the best one       is the one that maximizes the number of diplomas of the third degree.",

To do this, a team of workers was hired       and a schedule of work was made, according to which the       intersections should be asphalted. Road repairs are planned for  n 2 days. On the  i-th day of the team arrives at the  i-th intersection in the list and if none of the two roads that form       the intersection were already asphalted they asphalt both roads.       Otherwise, the team leaves the intersection, without doing       anything with the roads. According to the schedule of road works tell in which days at       least one road will be asphalted.","The first line contains integer  n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) — the number of       vertical and horizontal roads in the city.

One two-hour lesson at the Russian university is traditionally       called a pair, it lasts for       two academic hours (an academic hour is equal to 45 minutes). The University works in such a way that every day it holds       exactly  n lessons. Depending on the schedule of a       particular group of students, on a given day, some pairs may       actually contain classes, but some may be empty (such pairs are       called breaks).

Two opponents simultaneously charge a deadly       spell in the enemy. We know that the impulse of Harry's magic       spell flies at a speed of  p meters per second, and the impulse of       You-Know-Who's magic spell flies at a speed of  q meters per second. The impulses are moving through the corridor toward each other,       and at the time of the collision they turn round and fly back to       those who cast them without changing their original speeds. Then,       as soon as the impulse gets back to it's caster, the wizard       reflects it and sends again towards the enemy, without changing       the original speed of the impulse. Since Harry has perfectly mastered the basics of magic, he knows       that after the second collision both impulses will disappear, and       a powerful explosion will occur exactly in the place of their       collision. However, the young wizard isn't good at math, so he       asks you to calculate the distance from his position to the place       of the second meeting of the spell impulses, provided that the       opponents do not change positions during the whole fight.","The first line of the input contains a single integer  l (1 ≤ l ≤ 1 000) — the length of the       corridor where the fight takes place.

592,"Galois is one of the strongest chess players of Byteforces. He       has even invented a new variant of chess, which he named «PawnChess». This new game is played on a board consisting of 8 rows and 8       columns. At the beginning of every game some black and white pawns       are placed on the board. The number of black pawns placed is not       necessarily equal to the number of white pawns placed.  Lets enumerate rows and columns with integers from 1 to 8. Rows       are numbered from top to bottom, while columns are numbered from       left to right. Now we denote as (r, c) the cell located at       the row  r and at the column  c. There are always two players A and B playing the game. Player A       plays with white pawns, while player B plays with black ones. The       goal of player A is to put any of his pawns to the row 1, while player B tries to put any of his       pawns to the row 8. As soon as any       of the players completes his goal the game finishes immediately       and the succeeded player is declared a winner. Player A moves first and then they alternate turns. On his move       player A must choose exactly one white pawn and move it one step       upward and player B (at his turn) must choose exactly one black       pawn and move it one step down. Any move is possible only if the       targeted cell is empty. It's guaranteed that for any scenario of       the game there will always be at least one move available for any       of the players. Moving upward means that the pawn located in (r, c) will go to the cell         (r - 1, c), while       moving down means the pawn located in (r, c) will go to the cell         (r + 1, c). Again,       the corresponding cell must be empty, i.e. not occupied by any       other pawn of any color. Given the initial disposition of the board, determine who wins       the game if both players play optimally. Note that there will       always be a winner due to the restriction that for any game       scenario both players will have some moves available.","The input consists of the board description given in eight lines,       each line contains eight characters. Character 'B' is used to denote a black       pawn, and character 'W'       represents a white pawn. Empty cell is marked with '.'.  It's guaranteed that there will not be white pawns on the first       row neither black pawns on the last row.","Print 'A' if player A wins       the game on the given board, and 'B' if player B will claim the       victory. Again, it's guaranteed that there will always be a winner       on the given board.","In the first sample player A is able to complete his goal in 3       steps by always moving a pawn initially located at (4, 5). Player B needs at least 5 steps       for any of his pawns to reach the row 8. Hence, player A will be the winner."

Despite the challenging tasks, Kevin was uncowed and       bulldozed through all of them, distinguishing himself from the       herd as the best cowmputer scientist in all of Bovinia. Kevin       knows his submission time for each problem, the number of wrong       submissions that he made on each problem, and his total numbers of       successful and unsuccessful hacks. Because Codeforces scoring is       complicated, Kevin wants you to write a program to compute his       final score. Codeforces scores are computed as follows: If the maximum point       value of a problem is  x, and Kevin submitted correctly at minute  m but made  w wrong submissions, then his score on that       problem is .       His total score is equal to the sum of his scores for each       problem. In addition, Kevin's total score gets increased by 100 points for each successful hack, but       gets decreased by 50 points for each       unsuccessful hack. All arithmetic operations are performed with absolute precision       and no rounding. It is guaranteed that Kevin's final score is an integer.","The first line of the input contains five space-separated       integers  m 1,  m 2,  m 3,  m 4,  m 5, where  m  i (0 ≤ m  i ≤ 119) is the time of Kevin's last       submission for problem  i. His last submission is always correct and gets accepted. The second line contains five space-separated integers  w 1,  w 2,  w 3,  w 4,  w 5, where  w  i (0 ≤ w  i ≤ 10) is Kevin's number of wrong       submissions on problem  i. The last line contains two space-separated integers  h  s and  h  u (0 ≤ h  s, h  u ≤ 20), denoting the Kevin's numbers of       successful and unsuccessful hacks, respectively.","Print a single integer, the value of Kevin's final score.","In the second sample, Kevin takes 119 minutes on all of the problems.       Therefore, he gets        of the points on each problem. So his score from solving problems       is .       Adding in 10·100 = 1000 points from       hacks, his total score becomes 3930 + 1000 = 4930."

666,"First-rate specialists graduate from Berland State Institute of       Peace and Friendship. You are one of the most talented students in       this university. The education is not easy because you need to       have fundamental knowledge in different areas, which sometimes are       not related to each other.  For example, you should know linguistics very well. You learn a       structure of Reberland language as foreign language. In this       language words are constructed according to the following rules.       First you need to choose the ""root"" of the word — some       string which has more than 4       letters. Then several strings with the length 2 or 3       symbols are appended to this word. The only restriction —  it is not allowed to append the same         string twice in a row. All these strings are considered       to be suffixes of the word (this time we use word       ""suffix"" to describe a morpheme but not the few last       characters of the string as you may used to).  Here is one exercise that you have found in your task list. You       are given the word  s. Find all distinct strings with the length 2 or 3,       which can be suffixes of this word according to the word       constructing rules in Reberland language.  Two strings are considered distinct if they have different length       or there is a position in which corresponding characters do not       match.  Let's look at the example: the word  abacabaca is given. This word can be obtained in       the following ways: ,       where the root of the word is overlined, and suffixes are marked       by ""corners"". Thus, the set of possible suffixes for       this word is {aca, ba, ca}. ",The only line contains a string  s (5 ≤ |s| ≤ 104) consisting of lowercase       English letters.,On the first line print integer  k — a number of distinct possible suffixes. On the       next  k lines print suffixes.  Print suffixes in lexicographical (alphabetical) order. ,"The first test was analysed in the problem statement.  In the second example the length of the string equals 5. The length of the root equals 5, so no       string can be used as a suffix."
667,"A lot of people in Berland hates rain, but you do not. Rain       pacifies, puts your thoughts in order. By these years you have       developed a good tradition — when it rains, you go on the street       and stay silent for a moment, contemplate all around you, enjoy       freshness, think about big deeds you have to do.  Today everything had changed quietly. You went on the street with       a cup contained water, your favorite drink. In a moment when you       were drinking a water you noticed that the process became quite       long: the cup still contained water because of rain. You decided       to make a formal model of what was happening and to find if it was       possible to drink all water in that situation.  Thus, your cup is a cylinder with diameter equals  d centimeters. Initial level of water in cup       equals  h centimeters from the bottom.  You drink a water with a speed equals  v milliliters per second. But rain goes with such       speed that if you do not drink a water from the cup, the level of       water increases on  e centimeters per second. The process of drinking       water from the cup and the addition of rain to the cup goes evenly       and continuously.  Find the time needed to make the cup empty or find that it will       never happen. It is guaranteed that if it is possible to drink all       water, it will happen not later than after 104 seconds.

Otherwise print ""YES"" (without quotes) in the       first line. In the second line print a real number — time in       seconds needed the cup will be empty. The answer will be       considered correct if its relative or absolute error doesn't       exceed 10 - 4. It is guaranteed that if       the answer exists, it doesn't exceed 104.","In the first example the water fills the cup faster than you can       drink from it. In the second example area of the cup's bottom equals to ,       thus we can conclude that you decrease the level of water by        centimeters per second. At the same time water level increases by         1 centimeter per second due to       rain. Thus, cup will be empty in  seconds."

When ZS the Coder is at level  k, he can : Additionally, after each move, if ZS the Coder is at level  k, and the number on the screen is  m, then   m must be a multiple of  k. Note that this condition is only       checked after performing the press. For example, if ZS the Coder       is at level 4 and current number is         100, he presses the ''       button and the number turns into 10.       Note that at this moment, 10 is not       divisible by 4, but this press is       still valid, because after it, ZS the Coder is at level 5, and 10 is       divisible by 5.

Then, ZS the Coder       pressed the ''       button, and the number became .  After that, on the second level, ZS pressed the ' + ' button 16 times, so the number becomes 4 + 16·2 = 36. Then, ZS pressed the ''       button, levelling up and changing the number into . After that, on the third level, ZS pressed the ' + ' button 46 times, so the number becomes 6 + 46·3 = 144. Then, ZS pressed the ''       button, levelling up and changing the number into .  Note that 12 is indeed divisible by         4, so ZS the Coder can reach level         4. Also, note that pressing the ' + '       button 10 times on the third level       before levelling up does not work, because the number becomes         6 + 10·3 = 36, and when the ''       button is pressed, the number becomes        and ZS the Coder is at Level 4.

First he got disappointed, as he expected a way more       pleasant result. Then, he developed a tricky plan. Each second, he       can ask his teacher to round the grade at any place after the       decimal point (also, he can ask to round to the nearest integer).  There are  t seconds left till the end of the break, so Efim       has to act fast. Help him find what is the maximum grade he can       get in no more than  t seconds. Note, that he can choose to not use all          t seconds. Moreover, he can even choose to not       round the grade at all. In this problem, classic rounding rules are used: while rounding       number to the  n-th digit one has to take a look at the digit          n + 1. If it is less than 5 than the  n-th digit remain unchanged while all subsequent       digits are replaced with 0.       Otherwise, if the  n + 1 digit is greater or equal to 5, the digit at the position  n is increased by 1       (this might also change some other digits, if this one was equal       to 9) and all subsequent digits are       replaced with 0. At the end, all       trailing zeroes are thrown away. For example, if the number 1.14 is       rounded to the first decimal place, the result is 1.1, while if we round 1.5 to the nearest integer, the result is         2.

There are  n houses in that village, lining in a straight       line from left to right: house 1,       house 2, ..., house  n. The village is also well-structured: house          i and house  i + 1 (1 ≤ i < n) are exactly         10 meters away. In this village,       some houses are occupied, and some are not. Indeed, unoccupied       houses can be purchased. You will be given  n integers  a 1, a 2, ..., a  n that denote the availability and the       prices of the houses. If house  i is occupied, and therefore cannot be bought,       then  a  i equals 0.       Otherwise, house  i can be bought, and  a  i represents the money required to buy it,       in dollars. As Zane has only  k dollars to spare, it becomes a challenge for him       to choose the house to purchase, so that he could live as near as       possible to his crush.

Pasha received the information that the       website will be working only during  m time periods,  jth period is represented by its starting moment          l  j and ending moment  r  j. Of course, Pasha can send his solution       only when the website is working. In other words, Pasha can send       his solution at some moment  T iff there exists a period  x such that  l  x ≤ T ≤ r  x. Pasha wants to know his best possible result.

The third line contains one integer  m (0 ≤ m ≤ 1000) — the number of periods of       time when the website is working. Next  m lines represent these periods.  jth line contains two numbers  l  j and  r  j (1 ≤ l  j < r  j ≤ 105) —       the starting and the ending moment of  jth period.  It is guaranteed that the periods         are not intersecting and are given in chronological order, so         for every  j > 1 the condition  l  j > r  j - 1 is met.","If Pasha can solve and submit all the problems before the end of       the contest, print the minimal moment of time by which he can have       all the solutions submitted. Otherwise print ""-1"" (without brackets).","In the first example Pasha can act like this: he solves the       second problem in 4 units of time and sends it immediately. Then       he spends 3 time units to solve the first problem and sends it 7       time units after the contest starts, because at this moment the       website starts working again. In the second example Pasha invents the solution only after the       website stops working for the last time. In the third example Pasha sends the solution exactly at the end       of the first period."
814,"A few years ago, Hitagi encountered a giant crab, who stole the       whole of her body weight. Ever since, she tried to avoid contact       with others, for fear that this secret might be noticed. To get rid of the oddity and recover her weight, a special       integer sequence is needed. Hitagi's sequence has been broken for       a long time, but now Kaiki provides an opportunity. Hitagi's sequence  a has a length of  n. Lost elements in it are denoted by zeros. Kaiki       provides another sequence  b, whose length  k equals the number of lost elements in  a (i.e. the number of zeros). Hitagi is to replace       each zero in  a with an element from  b so that each         element in  b should be used exactly once. Hitagi       knows, however, that, apart from           0, no integer occurs in  a and  b more than once in total. If the resulting sequence is not an increasing sequence, then       it has the power to recover Hitagi from the oddity. You are to       determine whether this is possible, or Kaiki's sequence is just       another fake. In other words, you should detect whether it is       possible to replace each zero in  a with an integer from  b so that each integer from  b is used exactly once, and the resulting sequence       is not increasing.","The first line of input contains two space-separated positive       integers  n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) and  k (1 ≤ k ≤ n) — the lengths of       sequence  a and  b respectively. The second line contains  n space-separated integers  a 1, a 2, ..., a  n (0 ≤ a  i ≤ 200) — Hitagi's broken sequence with       exactly  k zero elements. The third line contains  k space-separated integers  b 1, b 2, ..., b  k (1 ≤ b  i ≤ 200) — the elements to fill into       Hitagi's sequence.

The players take turns appending letters to string  s. Mister B moves first. Mister B must append exactly  b letters on each his move. He can arbitrary       choose these letters. His opponent adds exactly  a letters on each move. Mister B quickly understood that his opponent was just a computer       that used a simple algorithm.

Slastyona managed to have spinner rotating for exactly  n seconds. Being fascinated by elegance of the       process, she completely forgot the direction the spinner was spun       in! Lucky for her, she managed to recall the starting position,       and wants to deduct the direction given the information she knows.       Help her do this.","There are two characters in the first string – the starting and       the ending position of a spinner. The position is encoded with one       of the following characters: v (ASCII code 118, lowercase v), < (ASCII code 60), ^ (ASCII code 94) or > (ASCII code 62) (see the picture above for reference).       Characters are separated by a single space. In the second strings, a single number  n is given (0 ≤ n ≤ 109) – the duration of the rotation. It is guaranteed that the ending position of a spinner is a       result of a  n second spin in any of the directions, assuming       the given starting position.","Output cw, if the       direction is clockwise, ccw – if counter-clockwise, and         undefined otherwise.",

847,"Doubly linked list is one of the fundamental data structures. A       doubly linked list is a sequence of elements, each containing       information about the previous and the next elements of the list.       In this problem all lists have linear structure. I.e. each element       except the first has exactly one previous element, each element       except the last has exactly one next element. The list is not       closed in a cycle. In this problem you are given  n memory cells forming one or more doubly linked       lists. Each cell contains information about element from some       list. Memory cells are numbered from 1 to  n. For each cell  i you are given two values:  If cell  i contains information about the element which has       no previous element then  l  i = 0. Similarly, if cell  i contains information about the element which has       no next element then  r  i = 0. For example, for the picture above the values of  l and  r are the following:  l 1 = 4,  r 1 = 7;  l 2 = 5,  r 2 = 0;  l 3 = 0,  r 3 = 0;  l 4 = 6,  r 4 = 1;  l 5 = 0,  r 5 = 2;  l 6 = 0,  r 6 = 4;  l 7 = 1,  r 7 = 0. Your task is to unite all given lists in a single list, joining       them to each other in any order. In particular, if the input data       already contains a single list, then there is no need to perform       any actions. Print the resulting list in the form of values  l  i,  r  i.

In the second example fair game is impossible because the numbers       written on the cards are equal, but the numbers that Petya and       Vasya should choose should be distinct. In the third example it is impossible to take all cards. Petya       and Vasya can take at most five cards — for example, Petya can       choose number 10 and Vasya can       choose number 20.

So the word corrector       works in such a way: as long as there are two consecutive vowels       in the word, it deletes the first vowel in a word such that there       is another vowel right before       it. If there are no two consecutive vowels in the word, it       is considered to be correct. You are given a word  s. Can you predict what will it become after correction?

Each cell is either empty,       contains a sheep, a wolf or a dog. Sheep and dogs always stay in       place, but wolves can roam freely around the pasture, by       repeatedly moving to the left, right, up or down to a neighboring       cell. When a wolf enters a cell with a sheep, it consumes it.       However, no wolf can enter a cell with a dog. Initially there are no dogs.

Find such code.","The first line contains two integers nn and mm (1≤n,m≤101≤n,m≤10) representing the number of digits in the       sequence you have and the number of keys on the keypad that have fingerprints. The next line contains nn distinct space-separated integers       x1,x2,…,xnx1,x2,…,xn (0≤xi≤90≤xi≤9) representing       the sequence. The next line contains mm distinct space-separated integers       y1,y2,…,ymy1,y2,…,ym (0≤yi≤90≤yi≤9) — the keys       with fingerprints.","In a single line print a space-separated sequence of integers       representing the code. If the resulting sequence is empty, both       printing nothing and printing a single line break is acceptable.","In the first example, the only digits with fingerprints are       11, 22 and 77. All three of them appear in the       sequence you know, 77 first, then 11 and then 22.       Therefore the output is 7 1       2. Note that the order is important, and shall be the same       as the order in the original sequence. In the second example digits 00, 11, 77 and       99 have fingerprints, however only 00 and 11 appear       in the original sequence. 11 appears earlier, so the output       is 1 0. Again, the order is important."
996,"Allen has a LOT of money. He has nn dollars in the bank. For       security reasons, he wants to withdraw it in cash (we will not       disclose the reasons here). The denominations for dollar bills are       11, 55, 1010, 2020, 100100. What is the       minimum number of bills Allen could receive after withdrawing his       entire balance?",The first and only line of input contains a single integer       nn (1≤n≤1091≤n≤109).,Output the minimum number of bills that Allen could receive.,"In the first sample case, Allen can withdraw this with a       100100 dollar bill, a 2020 dollar bill, and a 55       dollar bill. There is no way for Allen to receive 125125       dollars in one or two bills. In the second sample case, Allen can withdraw two 2020 dollar       bills and three 11 dollar bills. In the third sample case, Allen can withdraw 100000000100000000 (ten       million!) 100100 dollar bills."
998,"There are quite a lot of ways to have fun with inflatable       balloons. For example, you can fill them with water and see what happens. Grigory and Andrew have the same opinion. So, once upon a time,       they went to the shop and bought nn packets with inflatable       balloons, where ii-th of them has exactly aiai balloons inside. They want to divide the balloons among themselves. In addition,       there are several conditions to hold: Help them to divide the balloons or determine that it's       impossible under these conditions.","The first line of input contains a single integer nn (1≤n≤101≤n≤10) — the number of packets with balloons. The second line contains nn integers: a1a1, a2a2,       ……, anan (1≤ai≤10001≤ai≤1000) — the number of       balloons inside the corresponding packet.","If it's impossible to divide the balloons satisfying the       conditions above, print −1−1. Otherwise, print an integer kk — the number of packets to       give to Grigory followed by kk distinct integers from 11       to nn — the indices of those. The order of packets doesn't matter. If there are multiple ways to divide balloons, output any of them.",In the first test Grigory gets 33 balloons in total while       Andrey gets 11. In the second test there's only one way to divide the packets       which leads to equal numbers of balloons. In the third test one of the boys won't get a packet at all.
999,"Mishka started participating in a programming contest. There are       nn problems in the contest. Mishka's problem-solving skill is       equal to kk. Mishka arranges all problems from the contest into a list.       Because of his weird principles, Mishka only solves problems from       one of the ends of the list. Every time, he chooses which end       (left or right) he will solve the next problem from. Thus, each       problem Mishka solves is either the leftmost or the rightmost       problem in the list. Mishka cannot solve a problem with difficulty greater than       kk. When Mishka solves the problem, it disappears from the       list, so the length of the list decreases by 11. Mishka stops       when he is unable to solve any problem from any end of the list. How many problems can Mishka solve?","The first line of input contains two integers nn and kk       (1≤n,k≤1001≤n,k≤100) — the number of problems in the contest       and Mishka's problem-solving skill. The second line of input contains nn integers a1,a2,…,ana1,a2,…,an (1≤ai≤1001≤ai≤100), where aiai is the       difficulty of the ii-th problem. The problems are given in       order from the leftmost to the rightmost in the list.",Print one integer — the maximum number of problems Mishka can solve.,"In the first example, Mishka can solve problems in the following       order: [4,2,3,1,5,1,6,4]→[2,3,1,5,1,6,4]→[2,3,1,5,1,6]→[3,1,5,1,6]→[1,5,1,6]→[5,1,6][4,2,3,1,5,1,6,4]→[2,3,1,5,1,6,4]→[2,3,1,5,1,6]→[3,1,5,1,6]→[1,5,1,6]→[5,1,6], so the number       of solved problems will be equal to 55. In the second example, Mishka can't solve any problem because the       difficulties of problems from both ends are greater than kk. In the third example, Mishka's solving skill is so amazing that       he can solve all the problems."
