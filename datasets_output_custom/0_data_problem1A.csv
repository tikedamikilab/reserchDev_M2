On the occasion of the city's       anniversary, a decision was taken to pave the Square with square       granite flagstones. Each flagstone is of the size  a × a. What is the least number of flagstones needed to pave the Square?       It's allowed to cover the surface larger than the Theatre Square,       but the Square has to be covered.

6,"Johnny has a younger sister Anne, who is very clever and smart.       As she came home from the kindergarten, she told his brother about       the task that her kindergartener asked her to solve. The task was       just to construct a triangle out of four sticks of different       colours. Naturally, one of the sticks is extra. It is not allowed       to break the sticks or use their partial length. Anne has       perfectly solved this task, now she is asking Johnny to do the same. The boy answered that he would cope with it without any       difficulty. However, after a while he found out that different       tricky things can occur. It can happen that it is impossible to       construct a triangle of a positive area, but it is possible to       construct a degenerate triangle. It can be so, that it is       impossible to construct a degenerate triangle even. As Johnny is       very lazy, he does not want to consider such a big amount of       cases, he asks you to help him.",The first line of the input contains four space-separated       positive integer numbers not exceeding 100 — lengthes of the sticks.,Output TRIANGLE if it is       possible to construct a non-degenerate triangle.

73,"Vasya plays The Elder Trolls IV: Oblivon. Oh, those creators of       computer games! What they do not come up with! Absolutely unique       monsters have been added to the The Elder Trolls IV: Oblivon. One       of these monsters is Unkillable Slug. Why it is       ""Unkillable""? Firstly, because it can be killed with       cutting weapon only, so lovers of two-handed amber hammers should       find suitable knife themselves. Secondly, it is necessary to make       so many cutting strokes to Unkillable Slug. Extremely many. Too       many!  Vasya has already promoted his character to 80-th level and in       order to gain level 81 he was asked to kill Unkillable Slug. The       monster has a very interesting shape. It looks like a rectangular       parallelepiped with size  x × y × z, consisting of       undestructable cells 1 × 1 × 1. At       one stroke Vasya can cut the Slug along an imaginary grid, i.e.       cut with a plane parallel to one of the parallelepiped side.       Monster dies when amount of parts it is divided reaches some       critical value. All parts of monster do not fall after each cut, they remains       exactly on its places. I. e. Vasya can cut several parts with one cut. Vasya wants to know what the maximum number of pieces he can cut       the Unkillable Slug into striking him at most  k times.

667,"A lot of people in Berland hates rain, but you do not. Rain       pacifies, puts your thoughts in order. By these years you have       developed a good tradition — when it rains, you go on the street       and stay silent for a moment, contemplate all around you, enjoy       freshness, think about big deeds you have to do.  Today everything had changed quietly. You went on the street with       a cup contained water, your favorite drink. In a moment when you       were drinking a water you noticed that the process became quite       long: the cup still contained water because of rain. You decided       to make a formal model of what was happening and to find if it was       possible to drink all water in that situation.  Thus, your cup is a cylinder with diameter equals  d centimeters. Initial level of water in cup       equals  h centimeters from the bottom.  You drink a water with a speed equals  v milliliters per second. But rain goes with such       speed that if you do not drink a water from the cup, the level of       water increases on  e centimeters per second. The process of drinking       water from the cup and the addition of rain to the cup goes evenly       and continuously.  Find the time needed to make the cup empty or find that it will       never happen. It is guaranteed that if it is possible to drink all       water, it will happen not later than after 104 seconds. Note one milliliter equals to one cubic centimeter.","The only line of the input contains four integer numbers  d, h, v, e (1 ≤ d, h, v, e ≤ 104), where:","If it is impossible to make the cup empty, print ""NO"" (without quotes). Otherwise print ""YES"" (without quotes) in the       first line. In the second line print a real number — time in       seconds needed the cup will be empty. The answer will be       considered correct if its relative or absolute error doesn't       exceed 10 - 4. It is guaranteed that if       the answer exists, it doesn't exceed 104.","In the first example the water fills the cup faster than you can       drink from it. In the second example area of the cup's bottom equals to ,       thus we can conclude that you decrease the level of water by        centimeters per second. At the same time water level increases by         1 centimeter per second due to       rain. Thus, cup will be empty in  seconds."
